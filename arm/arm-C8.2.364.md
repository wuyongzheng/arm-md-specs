## C8.2.364 LD2W (scalar plus scalar)

Contiguous load two-word structures to two vectors (scalar index)

This instruction performs a contiguous load of two-word structures, each to the same element number in two vector registers from the memory address generated by a 64-bit scalar base and a 64-bit scalar index register scaled by the element size ( LSL option) and added to the base address. After each structure access the index value is incremented by two. The index register is not updated by the instruction.

Each predicate element applies to the same element number in each of the two vector registers, or equivalently to the two consecutive words in memory that make up each structure. Inactive elements will not cause a read from Device memory or signal a fault, and the corresponding element is set to zero in each of the two destination vector registers.
