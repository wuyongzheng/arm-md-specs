## D22.1 Overview

The Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) defines:

- Architectural state capable of holding two-dimensional matrix tiles.
- A Streaming SVE processing mode , which supports execution of SVE2 instructions with a vector length that matches the tile width.
- Instructions that accumulate the outer product of vectors into a tile.
- Load, store, and move instructions that transfer a vector to or from a tile row or column.

The extension also defines System registers and fields that identify the presence and capabilities of SME, and enable and control its behavior at each Exception level.

The Scalable Matrix Extension version 2 (SME2) extends the SME architecture to increase the number of applications that can benefit from the computational efficiency of SME resources, beyond their initial focus on outer products and matrix-matrix multiplication.

SME2 adds data processing instructions with multi-vector operands and a multi-vector predication mechanism.

These include:

- Multi-vector multiply-accumulate instructions, that read SVE Z vectors and accumulate into the SME ZA array vectors to permit reuse of the SME outer product hardware for vector operations, including widening multiplies that accumulate into more vectors than they read.
- Multi-vector instructions that read and write multiple SVE Z vectors to preprocess inputs and post-process outputs of the multi-vector multiply-accumulate and outer product instructions.
- An alternative predication mechanism to the SVE predication mechanism, to control operations performed on multiple vector registers.

## SME2 also adds:

- Compressed neural network capability using dedicated lookup table instructions and outer product instructions that support binary neural networks.
- A512-bit architectural register, ZT0, to support the lookup table feature.

Unless stated otherwise, the acronym SME applies to all implemented versions of the Scalable Matrix Extension.
