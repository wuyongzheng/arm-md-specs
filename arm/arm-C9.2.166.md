## C9.2.166 MOV (tile to vector, two registers)

Move ZA two-slice operand to Z two-vector operand

This instruction operates on a horizontal or vertical ZA two-slice operand within a ZA tile of the specified element size.

The first slice of the two-slice operand is selected by rounding down the sum of the slice index register and the immediate offset to the nearest lower multiple of 2, modulo the number of slices in the tile.

The immediate offset is a multiple of 2 in the range 0 to the number of elements in a 128-bit vector segment minus 2.

This instruction is unpredicated.

This is an alias of MOV A (tile to vector, two registers). This means:

- The encodings in this description are named to match the encodings of MOV A (tile to vector, two registers).
- The description of MOVA (tile to vector, two registers) gives the operational pseudocode, any CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE behavior, and any operational information for this instruction.

It has encodings from 4 classes: 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit

## 8-bit

## Encoding for the 8-bit variant

```
MOV { <Zd1>.B-<Zd2>.B }, ZA0<HV>.B[<Ws>, <offs1>:<offs2>]
```

## is equivalent to

```
MOVA { <Zd1>.B-<Zd2>.B }, ZA0<HV>.B[<Ws>, <offs1>:<offs2>]
```

and is always the preferred disassembly.

## 16-bit

## Encoding for the 16-bit variant

and is always the preferred disassembly.

## 32-bit

(FEAT\_SME2)

<!-- image -->

## Encoding for the 32-bit variant

```
MOV { <Zd1>.S-<Zd2>.S }, <ZAn><HV>.S[<Ws>, <offs1>:<offs2>]
```

## is equivalent to

```
MOVA { <Zd1>.S-<Zd2>.S }, <ZAn><HV>.S[<Ws>, <offs1>:<offs2>]
```

and is always the preferred disassembly.

## 64-bit

(FEAT\_SME2)

<!-- image -->

## Encoding for the 64-bit variant

```
MOV { <Zd1>.D-<Zd2>.D }, <ZAn><HV>.D[<Ws>, <offs1>:<offs2>]
```

## is equivalent to

MOVA { &lt;Zd1&gt;.D-&lt;Zd2&gt;.D }, &lt;ZAn&gt;&lt;HV&gt;.D[&lt;Ws&gt;, &lt;offs1&gt;:&lt;offs2&gt;]

and is always the preferred disassembly.
