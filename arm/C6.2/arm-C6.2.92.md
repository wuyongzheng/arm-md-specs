## C6.2.92 CMN (extended register)

Compare negative (extended register)

This instruction adds a register value and a sign or zero-extended register value, followed by an optional left shift amount. The argument that is extended from the &lt;Rm&gt; register can be a byte, halfword, word, or doubleword. It updates the condition flags based on the result, and discards the result.

This is an alias of ADDS (extended register). This means:

- The encodings in this description are named to match the encodings of ADDS (extended register).
- The description of ADDS (extended register) gives the operational pseudocode, any CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE behavior, and any operational information for this instruction.

## Encoding for the 32-bit variant

```
Applies when (sf == 0) CMN <Wn|WSP>, <Wm>{, <extend> {#<amount>}} is equivalent to ADDS WZR, <Wn|WSP>, <Wm>{, <extend> {#<amount>}}
```

and is always the preferred disassembly.

## Encoding for the 64-bit variant

```
Applies when (sf == 1) CMN <Xn|SP>, <R><m>{, <extend>
```

```
{#<amount>}} is equivalent to ADDS XZR, <Xn|SP>, <R><m>{, <extend> {#<amount>}}
```

and is always the preferred disassembly.

## Assembler Symbols

## &lt;Wn|WSP&gt;

Is the 32-bit name of the first source general-purpose register or stack pointer, encoded in the 'Rn' field.

## &lt;Wm&gt;

Is the 32-bit name of the second general-purpose source register, encoded in the 'Rm' field.

## &lt;extend&gt;

For the '32-bit' variant: is the extension to be applied to the second source operand, encoded in 'option':

Is a width specifier, encoded in 'option':

|   option | <extend>      |
|----------|---------------|
|      000 | UXTB          |
|      001 | UXTH          |
|      010 | LSL&#124;UXTW |
|      011 | UXTX          |
|      100 | SXTB          |
|      101 | SXTH          |
|      110 | SXTW          |
|      111 | SXTX          |

If 'Rn' is '11111' (WSP) and 'option' is '010' then LSL is preferred, but may be omitted when 'imm3' is '000'. In all other cases &lt;extend&gt; is required and must be UXTW when 'option' is '010'.

For the '64-bit' variant: is the extension to be applied to the second source operand, encoded in 'option':

|   option | <extend>      |
|----------|---------------|
|      000 | UXTB          |
|      001 | UXTH          |
|      010 | UXTW          |
|      011 | LSL&#124;UXTX |
|      100 | SXTB          |
|      101 | SXTH          |
|      110 | SXTW          |
|      111 | SXTX          |

If 'Rn' is '11111' (SP) and 'option' is '011' then LSL is preferred, but may be omitted when 'imm3' is '000'. In all other cases &lt;extend&gt; is required and must be UXTX when 'option' is '011'.

## &lt;amount&gt;

Is the left shift amount to be applied after extension in the range 0 to 4, defaulting to 0, encoded in the 'imm3' field. It must be absent when &lt;extend&gt; is absent, is required when &lt;extend&gt; is LSL, and is optional when &lt;extend&gt; is present but not LSL.

## &lt;Xn|SP&gt;

Is the 64-bit name of the first source general-purpose register or stack pointer, encoded in the 'Rn' field.

## &lt;R&gt;

| option   | <R>   |
|----------|-------|
| 00x      | W     |
| 010      | W     |

## &lt;m&gt;

Is the number [0-30] of the second general-purpose source register or the name ZR (31), encoded in the 'Rm' field.
