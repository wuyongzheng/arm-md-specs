## F5.1.225 STM, STMIA, STMEA

Store Multiple (Increment After, Empty Ascending) stores multiple registers to consecutive memory locations using an address from a base register. The consecutive memory locations start at this address, and the address just above the last of those locations can optionally be written back to the base register.

The lowest-numbered register is loaded from the lowest memory address, through to the highest-numbered register from the highest memory address. See also Encoding of lists of general-purpose registers and the PC.

Armv8.2 permits the deprecation of some Store Multiple ordering behaviors in AArch32 state, for more information see FEAT\_LSMAOC. For details of related system instructions see STM (User registers).

It has encodings from the following instruction sets: A32 (A1) and T32 (T1 and T2).

A1

## Encoding

```
STM{IA}{<c>}{<q>} <Rn>{!}, <registers> // (Preferred syntax) STMEA{<c>}{<q>} <Rn>{!}, <registers> // (Alternate syntax, Empty Ascending stack)
```

## Decode for this encoding

```
constant integer n = UInt(Rn); constant bits(16) registers = register_list; constant boolean wback = (W == '1'); if n == 15 || BitCount(registers) < 1 then UNPREDICTABLE;
```

## CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE behavior

If BitCount(registers) &lt; 1 , then one of the following behaviors must occur:

- The instruction is UNDEFINED.
- The instruction executes as NOP .
- The instruction operates as an STM with the same addressing mode but targeting an unspecified set of registers. These registers might include R15. If the instruction specifies writeback, the modification to the base address on writeback might differ from the number of registers stored.

If n == 15 &amp;&amp; wback , then one of the following behaviors must occur:

- The instruction is UNDEFINED.
- The instruction executes as NOP .
- The instruction executes without writeback of the base address.
- The instruction executes with writeback to the PC. The instruction is handled as described in Using R15.

T1

## Encoding

```
STM{IA}{<c>}{<q>} <Rn>!, <registers> // (Preferred syntax) STMEA{<c>}{<q>} <Rn>!, <registers> // (Alternate syntax, Empty Ascending stack)
```

## Decode for this encoding

```
constant integer n = UInt(Rn); constant bits(16) registers = constant boolean wback = TRUE; if BitCount(registers) < 1 then UNPREDICTABLE;
```

```
'00000000':register_list;

## CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE behavior

If BitCount(registers) &lt; 1 , then one of the following behaviors must occur:

- These registers might include R15. If the instruction specifies writeback, the modification to the base address on writeback might differ from the number of registers stored.

If n == 15 &amp;&amp; wback , then one of the following behaviors must occur:

## Assembler Symbols

## IA

Is an optional suffix for the Increment After form.

See Standard assembler syntax fields.

See Standard assembler syntax fields.

Is the general-purpose base register, encoded in the 'Rn' field.

&lt;c&gt;

&lt;q&gt;

## &lt;Rn&gt;

!

The address adjusted by the size of the data loaded is written back to the base register. If specified, it is encoded in the 'W' field as 1, otherwise this field defaults to 0.

## &lt;registers&gt;

For the 'A1' variant: is a list of one or more registers to be stored, separated by commas and surrounded by { and }.

The PC can be in the list. However, Arm deprecates the use of instructions that include the PC in the list.

If base register writeback is specified, and the base register is not the lowest-numbered register in the list, such an instruction stores an UNKNOWN value for the base register.

For the 'T1' variant: is a list of one or more registers to be stored, separated by commas and surrounded by { and }. The registers in the list must be in the range R0-R7, encoded in the 'register\_list' field. If the base register is not the lowest-numbered register in the list, such an instruction stores an UNKNOWN value for the base register.

For the 'T2' variant: is a list of one or more registers to be stored, separated by commas and surrounded by { and }.

The registers in the list must be in the range R0-R12, encoded in the 'register\_list' field, and can optionally contain the LR. If the LR is in the list, the 'M' field is set to 1, otherwise it defaults to 0.

## Operation

```
if ConditionPassed() then EncodingSpecificOperations(); bits(32) address = R[n]; for i = 0 to 14 if registers<i> == '1' then if i == n && wback && i != LowestSetBit(registers) then MemS[address,4] = bits(32) UNKNOWN; // Only possible for encodings T1 and A1 else MemS[address,4] = R[i]; address = address + 4; if registers<15> == '1' then // Only possible for encoding A1 MemS[address,4] = PCStoreValue(); if wback then R[n] = R[n] + 4*BitCount(registers);
```
