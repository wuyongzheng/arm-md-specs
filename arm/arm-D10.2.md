## D10.2 Allocation Tags

| D LLSFJ   | All statements in this section require implementation of FEAT_MTE2.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| R CWPLY   | Each set of 16 naturally-aligned bytes in memory is a Tag Granule .                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| R XQBST   | Each Tag Granule is associated with an Allocation Tag in memory.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| R CRCLC   | An Allocation Tag is a 4-bit value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| R QYCTT   | All accesses to any Allocation Tag are single-copy atomic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| R CPMDB   | All implicit and explicit accesses to Allocation Tags are regarded as streams of accesses to Allocation Tags , and no atomicity between accesses to different Allocation Tags , or between accesses to Allocation Tags and accesses to bytes, is ensured by the architecture. |
| R YSRGL   | An instruction that explicitly accesses an Allocation Tag at a VA accesses the Allocation Tag at the VA aligned to the Tag Granule .                                                                                                                                          |
| R PJCWS   | For an instruction that explicitly accesses both Allocation Tags and data, any MMUfaults generated by the separate accesses are not ordered.                                                                                                                                  |
