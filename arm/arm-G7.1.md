## G7.1 The AArch32 System register encoding space

The T32 and A32 instruction sets includes instructions that access the System register encoding space. These instructions provide:

- Access to System registers , including the debug registers, that provide system control, and system status information.
- The cache, branch predictor, and TLB maintenance instructions, and address translation instructions.

The AArch32 System register interface describes the instructions that provide access to these registers and instructions. AArch32 System Register Descriptions describes these registers and encodings.

When accessing 32-bit registers, or executing these instructions, entries in the encoding space are characterized by the parameter set { coproc , CRn , opc1 , CRm , opc2 }. This encoding space is defined only for the coproc values 0b1110 and 0b1111 .

## Note

- When accessing 64-bit registers entries in the encoding space are characterized by the parameter set { coproc , CRm , opc1 }, for the coproc values 0b1110 and 0b1111 . A CRm value in this parameter set is equivalent to a CRn value in the parameter set for accessing 32-bit registers.
- Background to the System register interface gives more information about this encoding model.

The following describe this encoding space:

- Organization of registers in the ( coproc == 0b1110 ) encoding space.
- Organization of registers in the ( coproc == 0b1111 ) encoding space.
