## H2.1 About Debug state

In external debug, debug events allow an external debugger to halt the PE. The PE then enters Debug state. When the PE is in Debug state:

- It stops executing instructions from the location indicated by the Program Counter, and is instead controlled through the external debug interface.
- The Instruction Transfer Register, ITR, passes instructions to the PE to execute in Debug state.
- The Debug Communications Channel , DCC, passes data between the PE and the debugger.

The PE cannot service any interrupts in Debug state.
