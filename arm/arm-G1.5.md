## G1.5 Instruction Set state

In AArch32 state, the Instruction Set state determines the instruction set that the PE is executing. In an implementation that follows the Arm recommendations, the available Instruction Set states are:

T32 state

The PE is executing T32 instructions.

A32 state

The PE is executing A32 instructions.

Note

In previous versions of the Arm architecture:

- The T32 instruction set was called the Thumb instruction set.
- The A32 instruction set was called the ARM instruction set.
