## C8.2.747 ST4B (scalar plus scalar)

Contiguous store four-byte structures from four vectors (scalar index)

This instruction performs a contiguous store of four-byte structures, each from the same element number in four vector registers to the memory address generated by a 64-bit scalar base and a 64-bit scalar index register and added to the base address. After each structure access the index value is incremented by four. The index register is not updated by the instruction.

Each predicate element applies to the same element number in each of the four vector registers, or equivalently to the four consecutive bytes in memory that make up each structure. Inactive structures are not written to memory.

## Encoding

```
ST4B { <Zt1>.B, <Zt2>.B, <Zt3>.B, <Zt4>.B },
```

## Decode for this encoding

```
if !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_SVE) && !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_SME) then EndOfDecode(Decode_UNDEF); if Rm == '11111' then EndOfDecode(Decode_UNDEF); constant integer t = UInt(Zt); constant integer n = UInt(Rn); constant integer m = UInt(Rm); constant integer g = UInt(Pg); constant integer esize = 8; constant integer nreg = 4;
