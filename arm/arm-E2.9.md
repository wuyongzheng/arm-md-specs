## E2.9 Mismatched memory attributes

Mismatched memory attributes are controlled by privileged software. For more information, see The AArch32 Virtual Memory System Architecture.

Physical memory Locations are accessed with mismatched attributes if all accesses to the Location do not use a common definition of all of the following attributes of that Location:

- Memory type: Device-nGnRnE, Device-nGnRE, Device-nGRE, Device-GRE or Normal.
- Shareability.
- Cacheability, for the same level of the inner or outer cache, but excluding any cache allocation hints.

Collectively these are referred to as memory attributes.

Note

In this document, the terms location and memory location refer to any byte within the current coherency granule and are used interchangeably.

When a memory Location is accessed with mismatched attributes the only software visible effects are one or more of the following:

- Uniprocessor semantics for reads and writes to that memory Location might be lost. This means:
- -Aread of the memory Location by one agent might not return the value most recently written to that memory Location by the same agent.
- -Multiple writes to the memory Location by one agent with different memory attributes might not be ordered in program order.
- There might be a loss of coherency when multiple agents attempt to access a memory Location.
- There might be a loss of properties derived from the memory type, as described in later bullets in this section.
- If all Load-Exclusive/Store-Exclusive instructions executed across all threads to access a given memory Location do not use consistent memory attributes, the Exclusives monitor state becomes UNKNOWN.
- Bytes written without the Write-Back cacheable attribute within the same Write-Back granule as bytes written with the Write-Back cacheable attribute might have their values reverted to the old values as a result of cache Write-Back.

The loss of properties associated with mismatched memory type attributes refers only to the following properties of Device memory that are additional to the properties of Normal memory:

- Prohibition of speculative read accesses.
- Prohibition on Gathering.
- Prohibition on Reordering.

For the following situations, when a physical memory Location is accessed with mismatched attributes, a more restrictive set of behaviors applies. The description of each situation also describes the behaviors that apply:

1. Any agent that reads that memory Location using the same common definition of the Memory type, Shareability and Cacheability attributes is guaranteed to access it coherently, to the extent required by that common definition of the memory attributes, only if all the following conditions are met:
- All writes are performed to an alias of the memory Location that uses the same definition of the Memory type, Shareability and Cacheability attributes.
- Either:
4. -All writes are performed to an alias of the memory Location that has Inner Cacheability and Outer Cacheability attributes both as Non-cacheable.
5. -All aliases to a memory Location use a definition of the Shareability attributes that encompasses all the agents with permission to access the Location.
2. The possible software-visible effects caused by mismatched attributes for a memory Location are defined more precisely if all of the mismatched attributes define the memory Location as one of:
- Any Device memory type.

- Normal Inner Non-cacheable, Outer Non-cacheable memory.

In these cases, the only permitted software-visible effects of the mismatched attributes are one or more of the following:

- Possible loss of properties derived from the memory type when multiple agents attempt to access the memory Location.
- Possible reordering of memory transactions to the same memory Location with different memory attributes, potentially leading to a loss of coherency or uniprocessor semantics. Any possible loss of coherency or uniprocessor semantics can be avoided by inserting DMB barrier instructions between accesses to the same memory Location that might use different attributes.

Where there is a loss of the uniprocessor semantics, ordering, or coherency, the following approaches can be used:

1. If the mismatched attributes for a memory Location all assign the same Shareability attribute to a Location that has a cacheable attribute, any loss of uniprocessor semantics, ordering, or coherency within a Shareability domain can be avoided by use of software cache management. To do so, software must use the techniques that are required for the software management of the ordering or coherency of cacheable Locations between agents in different shareability domains. This means:
- Before writing to a cacheable Location not using the Write-Back attribute, software must invalidate, or clean, a Location from the caches if any agent might have written to the Location with the Write-Back attribute. This avoids the possibility of overwriting the Location with stale data.
- After writing to a cacheable Location with the Write-Back attribute, software must clean the Location from the caches, to make the write visible to external memory.
- Before reading the Location with a cacheable attribute, software must invalidate, or clean and invalidate, the Location from the caches, to ensure that any value held in the caches reflects the last value made visible in external memory.
- Executing a DMB barrier instruction, with scope that applies to the common Shareability of the accesses, between any accesses to the same cacheable Location that use different attributes.

Note

In AArch32 state, cache maintenance instructions can be accessed only from an Exception level that is higher than EL0, and therefore require a system call. For information on system calls, see Exception-generating and exception-handling instructions. For information about the AArch32 cache maintenance instructions, see AArch32 cache and branch predictor support.

In all cases:

- Location refers to any byte within the current coherency granule.
- Aclean and invalidate instruction can be used instead of a clean instruction, or instead of an invalidate instruction.
- In the sequences outlined in this section, all cache maintenance instructions and memory transactions must be completed, or ordered by the use of barrier operations, if they are not naturally ordered by the use of a common address, see Ordering of cache and branch predictor maintenance instructions.
2. If the mismatched attributes for a Location mean that multiple cacheable accesses to the Location might be made with different Shareability attributes, then ordering and coherency are guaranteed only if:
- Software running on a PE cleans and invalidates a Location from cache before and after each read or write to that Location by that PE.
- A DMB barrier with scope that covers the full Shareability of the accesses is placed between any accesses to the same memory Location that use different attributes.

Note

With software management of coherency, race conditions can cause loss of data. A race condition occurs when different agents write simultaneously to bytes that are in the same Location, and the invalidate, write, clean sequence of one agent overlaps with the equivalent sequence of another agent. A race condition also occurs if the first operation of either sequence is a clean, rather than an invalidate.

Note

The Note in rule 1 of this list, about possible race conditions, also applies to this rule.

In addition, if multiple agents attempt to use Load-Exclusive or Store-Exclusive instructions to access a Location, and the accesses from the different agents have different memory attributes associated with the Location, the Exclusives monitor state becomes UNKNOWN.

Arm strongly recommends that software does not use mismatched attributes for aliases of the same Location. An implementation might not optimize the performance of a system that uses mismatched aliases.

Note

As described in Non-cacheable accesses and instruction caches, a non-cacheable access is permitted to be cached in an instruction cache, despite the fact that a non-cacheable access is not permitted to be cached in a unified cache. Despite this, when cacheable and non-cacheable aliases exist for memory which is executable, these must be treated as mismatched aliases to avoid coherency issues from the data or unified caches that might hold entries that will be brought into the instruction caches.
