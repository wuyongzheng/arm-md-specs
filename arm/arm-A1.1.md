## A1.1 About the Arm architecture

The Arm architecture described in this Architecture Reference Manual defines the behavior of an abstract machine, referred to as a processing element , often abbreviated to PE . Implementations compliant with the Arm architecture must conform to the described behavior of the processing element. It is not intended to describe how to build an implementation of the PE, nor to limit the scope of such implementations beyond the defined behaviors.

Except where the architecture specifies differently, the programmer-visible behavior of an implementation that is compliant with the Arm architecture must be the same as a simple sequential execution of the program on the processing element. The programmer-visible behavior does not include a specified execution time for any instruction but requires each instruction to execute in finite time, as long as another observer is not continually modifying any Location associated with a Memory Effect, other than an Explicit Memory Effect, that is architecturally required for execution of the instruction. In cases where another observer is continually modifying a Location associated with a Memory Effect, other than an Explicit Memory Effect, at least one of the observers must make forward progress in finite time. Unless otherwise specified, the architecturally defined effects of each instruction also complete in finite time.

The Arm Architecture Reference Manual also describes rules for software to use the PE.

The Arm architecture includes definitions of:

- An associated debug architecture, see:
- -AArch64 Self-hosted Debug.
- -AArch32 Self-hosted Debug.
- -External Debug.
- Associated trace architectures that define trace units that implementers can implement with the associated processor hardware. For more information, see:
- -The Arm ® Embedded Trace Macrocell Architecture Specification, ETMv4 (ARM IHI 0064).
- -AArch64 Self-hosted Trace.
- -The Embedded Trace Extension.
- -The Trace Buffer Extension.
- -AArch32 Self-hosted Trace.

Arm also provides system architecture specifications for systems aimed at particular product categories, such as servers, or personal computers, Arm ® Server Base System Architecture (ARM DEN 0029) and Arm ® Base System Architecture (ARM DEN 0094). These specifications build on the architecture specification in this Manual, restricting, as defined in those specifications, some of the optional and IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED features defined in this specification, as well as specifying additional features applicable at the system level.

The Arm architecture is a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture with the following RISC architecture features:

- Alarge uniform register file.
- A load/store architecture, where data-processing operations only operate on register contents, not directly on memory contents.
- Simple addressing modes, with all load/store addresses determined from register contents and instruction fields only.

The architecture defines the interaction of the PE with memory, including caches, and includes a memory translation system. It also describes how multiple PEs interact with each other and with other observers in a system.

This document defines versions 8 and 9 of the A-profile architecture.

See Architecture profiles for more information.

The Arm architecture supports implementations across a wide range of performance points. Implementation size, performance, and very low power consumption are key attributes of the Arm architecture.

An important feature of the Arm architecture is backward compatibility, combined with the freedom for optimal implementation in a wide range of standard and more specialized use cases.

The Arm architecture supports:

- A64-bit Execution state, AArch64.

- A32-bit Execution state, AArch32, that is compatible with previous versions of the Arm architecture.

Features that are optional are explicitly defined as such in this Manual.

Note

The presence of an ID register field for a feature does not imply that the feature is optional.

Both Execution states support floating-point instructions:

- AArch32 state provides:

- SIMD instructions in the base instruction sets that operate on the 32-bit general-purpose registers.

- Advanced SIMD instructions that operate on registers in the SIMD and floating-point register (SIMD&amp;FP register) file.

- Scalar floating-point instructions that operate on registers in the SIMD&amp;FP register file.

- AArch64 state provides:

- Advanced SIMD instructions that operate on registers in the SIMD&amp;FP register file.

- Scalar floating-point instructions that operate on registers in the SIMD&amp;FP register file.

Note

The A64 instruction set does not include SIMD instructions that operate on the general-purpose registers, therefore, some AArch64 instructions descriptions use SIMD as a synonym for Advanced SIMD.

- SVE instructions that operate on registers in the SVE register files.

- SMEinstructions that operate on registers in the SVE register files and ZA storage.
