## H4.6 Interrupt-driven use of the DCC

Arm recommends implementations provide a level-sensitive DCC interrupt request through the IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED interrupt controller as a Private Peripheral Interrupt for the originating PE.

Note

- In addition to connection to the interrupt controller Arm also recommends COMMIRQ , COMMTX , and COMMRX signals that might be implemented for use by any legacy system peripherals.
- GICv3 reserves a Private Peripheral Interrupt number for the COMMIRQ interrupt.

The DCCINT register provides a first level of interrupt masking within the PE, meaning only a single interrupt source, COMMIRQ , is needed at the interrupt controller.
