## F1.6 Encoding of lists of general-purpose registers and the PC

Anumber of instructions operate on lists of general-purpose registers. For some load instructions, the list of registers to be loaded can include the PC. For these instructions, the assembler syntax includes a &lt;registers&gt; field, which provides a list of the registers to be operated on, with list entries separated by commas.

The registers list is encoded in the instruction encoding. Most often, this is done using an 8-bit, 13-bit, or 16-bit register\_list field. This section gives more information about these and other possible register list encodings.

In a register\_list field, each bit corresponds to a single register, and if the &lt;registers&gt; field of the assembler instruction includes Rt then register\_list&lt;t&gt; is set to 1, otherwise it is set to 0.

The full rules for the encoding of lists of general-purpose registers, and possibly the PC, are:

- Except for the cases listed here, 16-bit T32 encodings use an 8-bit register list, and can access only registers R0-R7.

The exceptions to this rule are:

- The T1 encoding of POP uses an 8-bit register list, and an additional bit, P , that corresponds to the PC. This means it can access any of R0-R7 and the PC.

- The T1 encoding of PUSH uses an 8-bit register list, and an additional bit, M , that corresponds to the LR. This means it can access any of R0-R7 and the LR.

- 32-bit T32 encodings of load operations use a 13-bit register list, and two additional bits, M , corresponding to the LR, and P , corresponding to the PC. This means these instructions can access any of R0-R12 and the LR and PC.

- 32-bit T32 encodings of store operations use a 13-bit register list, and one additional bit, M , corresponding to the LR. This means these instructions can access any of R0-R12 and the LR.

- Except for the case listed here, A32 encodings use a 16-bit register list. This means these instructions can access any of R0-R12 and the SP, LR, and PC.

The exception to this rule is:

- The System instructions LDM (exception return) and LDM (User registers) use a 15-bit register list. This means these instructions can access any of R0-R12 and the SP and LR.

- The T3 and A2 encodings of POP , and the T3 and A2 encodings of PUSH , access a single register from the set of registers {R0-R12, LR, PC} and encode the register number in the Rt field.

Note

POP is a load operation, and PUSH is a store operation.

In every case, the encoding-specific pseudocode converts the register list into a 32-bit variable, registers , with a bit corresponding to each of the registers R0-R12, SP, LR, and PC.

Note

Some Advanced SIMD and floating-point instructions operate on lists of SIMD and floating-point registers. The assembler syntax of these instructions includes a &lt;list&gt; field that specifies the registers to be operated on, and the description of the instruction in Alphabetical list of T32 and A32 base instruction set instructions defines the use and encoding of this field.
