## B2.8 Alignment support

This section describes alignment support. It contains the following subsections:

- Instruction alignment.
- Alignment of data accesses.

## B2.8.1 Instruction alignment

A64 instructions must be word-aligned.

Attempting to fetch an instruction from a misaligned location results in a PC alignment fault. See PC alignment checking.

## B2.8.2 Alignment of data accesses

When instructions that load or store single or multiple registers are executed, if the value of SCTLR\_ELx.A applicable to the current Exception level is 1, an Alignment fault is generated if any of the following apply:

- For Load-Exclusive, Store-Exclusive, and Atomic instructions, the address that is accessed is not aligned to the overall access size.
- For all other instructions, the address that is accessed is not aligned to the size of the data element being accessed.

If FEAT\_LSE2 is implemented, Load-Acquire/Store-Release instructions without exclusive or atomic behavior generate an Alignment fault if all of the following apply:

- Not all bytes of the memory access lie within a 16-byte quantity aligned to 16 bytes.
- The value of SCTLR\_ELx.nAA applicable to the current Exception level is 0.

For an unaligned access to any type of Device memory:

- If the memory location cannot support unaligned accesses then an Alignment fault is generated.
- If the memory location supports unaligned accesses, then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether the access generates an Alignment fault if the location would not generate an Alignment fault if the same access were made to Normal memory.

## B2.8.2.1 Unaligned accesses to Normal memory

The behavior of unaligned accesses to Normal memory is dependent on all of the following:

- The instruction causing the memory access.
- The memory attributes of the accessed memory.
- The value of SCTLR\_ELx.{A, nAA}.
- Whether or not FEAT\_LSE2 is implemented.

## B2.8.2.1.1 Load or Store of Single or Multiple registers

For all instructions that load or store single or multiple registers, but not Load-Exclusive, Store-Exclusive, Load-Acquire/Store-Release, Atomic, and SETG* Memory Copy and Memory Set instructions, if the address that is accessed is not aligned to the size of the data element being accessed, then:

When the value of SCTLR\_ELx.A applicable to the current Exception level is 1, an Alignment fault is generated.

When the value of SCTLR\_ELx.A applicable to the current Exception level is 0:

- An unaligned access is performed.
- If FEAT\_LSE2 is not implemented, the access is not guaranteed to be single-copy atomic except at the byte access level.
- If FEAT\_LSE2 is implemented:

- -If all the bytes of the memory access lie within a 16-byte quantity aligned to 16 bytes and are to Normal Inner Write-Back, Outer Write-Back Cacheable, Shareable memory, the memory access is single-copy atomic. For LDNP , LDP , or STP instructions, the entire memory access will be single-copy atomic.
- -If all the bytes of the memory accessed do not lie within a 16-byte quantity aligned to 16 bytes, or the access is not to Normal Inner Write-Back, Outer Write-Back Cacheable, Shareable memory, the access is not guaranteed to be single-copy atomic except at the byte access level.

For these instructions, the definition of an unaligned access is based on the size of the accessed elements, not the overall size of the memory access. This affects SIMD and SVE element and structure loads and stores, and also load/store pair instructions.

For predicated SVE vector element and structure load or store instructions, alignment checks are based on the memory element access size, not on the vector element size.

For predicated SVE vector element and structure load or store instructions, Inactive elements cannot cause an Alignment fault.

For unpredicated SVE vector register load or store instructions, the base address is checked for 16-byte alignment.

For unpredicated SVE predicate register load or store instructions, the base address is checked for 2-byte alignment.

## B2.8.2.1.2 Load-Exclusive/ Store-Exclusive and Atomic instructions

If FEAT\_LSE2 is not implemented and the value of SCTLR\_ELx.A applicable to the current Exception level is 0, Load-Exclusive/Store-Exclusive and Atomic instructions, including those with acquire or release semantics, generate an alignment fault when the address being accessed is not aligned to the overall size of the access.

If FEAT\_LSE2 is implemented, then:

- If all the bytes of the memory access lie within a 16-byte quantity aligned to 16 bytes and are to Normal Inner Write-Back, Outer Write-Back Cacheable, Shareable memory, an unaligned access is performed.
- If all the bytes of the memory access do not lie within a 16-byte quantity aligned to 16-bytes, or the memory access is not to Normal Inner Write-Back, Outer Write-Back Cacheable, Shareable memory, then it is a CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE choice of either of the following:
- -An unaligned access is performed meeting all of the semantics of the instruction.
- -An Alignment fault is generated.

Where memory access is performed, then it is single-copy atomic.

For these instructions, the definition of an unaligned access is based on the overall access size.

If FEAT\_LS64 is implemented, when a single-copy atomic 64-byte instruction accesses a memory location that is not aligned to 64 bytes, an Alignment fault always occurs, regardless of the value of SCTLR\_ELx.A.

If FEAT\_THE is implemented, Read-Check-Write instructions, RCW , and Read-Check-Write Software instructions, RCWS , generate an Alignment fault if the address being accessed is not aligned to the overall access size regardless of the value of SCTLR\_ELx.A.

## B2.8.2.1.3 Non-atomic Load-Acquire/Store-Release instructions

For Load-Acquire/Store-Release instructions that do not have exclusive or atomic behaviors, when the address being accessed is not aligned to the size of the data element being accessed and the value of SCTLR\_ELx.A applicable to the current Exception level is 0:

If FEAT\_LSE2 is not implemented, then these instructions generate an Alignment fault.

If FEAT\_LSE2 is implemented, then:

- If the memory access is not to Normal Inner Write-Back, Outer Write-Back Cacheable, Shareable memory, then it is a CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE choice of either of the following:
- -An unaligned access is performed which is not guaranteed to be single-copy atomic except at the byte access level.
- -An Alignment fault is generated.
- If all of the bytes of the memory access do not lie within a 16-byte quantity aligned to 16 bytes and SCTLR\_ELx.nAA applicable to the current Exception level is 1, then an unaligned access is performed which is not guaranteed to be single-copy atomic except at the byte access level.

In this case, when an access is performed it meets all the semantics of the instruction, but the architecture does not define the order of the different transactions of the access defined by the single instructions relative to each other.

- If all the bytes of the memory access lie within a 16-byte quantity aligned to 16 bytes and are to Normal Inner Write-Back, Outer Write-Back Cacheable, Shareable memory, an unaligned access meeting all the semantics of the instruction is performed.

Note

- Unaligned accesses typically take additional cycles to complete compared to a naturally-aligned access.
- An operation that is not single-copy atomic above the byte level can abort on any memory access that it makes and can abort on more than one access. This means that an unaligned access that occurs across a page boundary can generate an abort on either side of the page boundary.

## B2.8.2.1.4 Memory Copy and Memory Set instructions

For SETG*

instructions:

- There is an alignment check regardless of the value of SCTLR\_ELx.A.
- If Xn is not a multiple of 16, an Alignment fault is generated.
- If Xd is not aligned to a multiple of 16, an Alignment fault is generated.

For more information, see the individual SETG* instruction descriptions.
