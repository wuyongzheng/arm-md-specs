## I1.2 Synchronization of memory-mapped registers

This section describes the synchronization requirements for the memory-mapped accesses to System registers.

This section refers to accesses to external system control registers as external reads and external writes. It refers to accesses to System registers as direct reads, direct writes, indirect reads, and indirect writes.

Note

Synchronization requirements for AArch64 System registers and Synchronization of changes to AArch32 System registers define direct read, direct write, indirect read, and indirect write, and classifies external reads as indirect reads and external writes as indirect writes.

Writes to the same register are serialized, meaning they are observed in the same order by all observers, although some observers might not observe all of the writes. Unless otherwise stated, external writes to different registers are not necessarily observed in the same order by all observers as the order in which they complete.

Explicit synchronization is not required for an external read or an external write by an external agent to be observable to a following external read or external write by that agent to the same register using the same address, and so is never required for registers that are accessible as external system control registers.

Unless required to be observable to all observers in finite time, without explicit synchronization, explicit synchronization is normally required following an external write to any register for that write to be observable by:

- Adirect access.
- An indirect read by an instruction.
- An external read of the register using a different address.

This means that an external write by an external agent is guaranteed to have an effect on subsequent instructions executed by the PE only if all of the following are true:

- The write has completed.
- The PE has executed a Context synchronization event.
- The Context synchronization event was executed after the write completed.

The order and synchronization of direct reads and direct writes of System registers is defined by:

- Synchronization requirements for AArch64 System registers.
- Synchronization of changes to AArch32 System registers.

The external agent must be able to guarantee completion of a write. For example, the agent can:

- Mark the memory as Device-nGnRnE and executing a DSB barrier, if the system supports this property.
- If the register is read/write and reads are not destructive, read back the value written.
- Use some guaranteed property of the connection between the PE and the external agent.

The external agent and PE can guarantee ordering by, for example, passing messages in an ordered way with respect to the external write and the Context synchronization event, and relying on the memory ordering rules provided by the memory model.

External reads and external write complete in the order in which they arrive at the PE. For accesses to different register locations, the external agent must create this order. The agent can:

- Mark the memory as Device-nGnRnE or Device-nGnRE.
- Use the appropriate memory barriers.
- Rely on some guaranteed property of the connection between the PE and the external agent.

However, the external agent cannot force the synchronization of completed writes.

In a simple sequential execution, an indirect write that occurs as a side-effect of an access happens atomically with the access, meaning no other accesses are allowed between the register access and its side-effect.

Without explicit synchronization to guarantee the order of the accesses, where the same register is accessed by two or more of a System register access instruction, and external agent, and autonomous asynchronous event, or as a result of a memory-mapped access, the behavior must be as if the accesses occurred atomically and in any order. This applies even if the accesses occur simultaneously.

For example, some registers have the property that for certain bits a write of 0 is ignored and a write of 1 has an effect. This means the simultaneous writes must be merged.
