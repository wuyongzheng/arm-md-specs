## C7.2.129 FMAXP (vector)

Floating-point maximum pairwise (vector)

This instruction creates a vector by concatenating the vector elements of the first source SIMD&amp;FP register after the vector elements of the second source SIMD&amp;FP register, reads each pair of adjacent vector elements from the concatenated vector, writes the larger of each pair of values into a vector, and writes the vector to the destination SIMD&amp;FP register. All the values in this instruction are floating-point values.

When FPCR.AH is 0, the behavior is as follows for each pairwise operation:

- Negative zero compares less than positive zero.
- When FPCR.DN is 0, if either element is a NaN, the result is a quiet NaN.
- When FPCR.DN is 1, if either element is a NaN, the result is Default NaN.

When FPCR.AH is 1, the behavior is as follows for each pairwise operation:

- If both elements are zeros, regardless of the sign of either zero, the result is the second element.
- If either element is a NaN, regardless of the value of FPCR.DN, the result is the second element.

This instruction can generate a floating-point exception. Depending on the settings in FPCR, the exception results in either a flag being set in FPSR or a synchronous exception being generated. For more information, see Floating-point exceptions and exception traps.

Depending on the settings in the CPACR\_EL1, CPTR\_EL2, and CPTR\_EL3 registers, and the current Security state and Exception level, an attempt to execute the instruction might be trapped.

It has encodings from 2 classes: Half-precision and Single-precision and double-precision

## Half-precision

## (FEAT\_AdvSIMD &amp;&amp; FEAT\_FP16)

## Encoding

```
