## C7.2.131 FMIN (vector)

Floating-point minimum (vector)

This instruction compares corresponding elements in the vectors in the two source SIMD&amp;FP registers, places the smaller of each of the two floating-point values into a vector, and writes the vector to the destination SIMD&amp;FP register.

When FPCR.AH is 0, the behavior is as follows:

- Negative zero compares less than positive zero.
- When FPCR.DN is 0, if either element is a NaN, the result is a quiet NaN.
- When FPCR.DN is 1, if either element is a NaN, the result is Default NaN.

When FPCR.AH is 1, the behavior is as follows:

- If both elements are zeros, regardless of the sign of either zero, the result is the second element.
- If either element is a NaN, regardless of the value of FPCR.DN, the result is the second element.

This instruction can generate a floating-point exception. Depending on the settings in FPCR, the exception results in either a flag being set in FPSR or a synchronous exception being generated. For more information, see Floating-point exceptions and exception traps.

Depending on the settings in the CPACR\_EL1, CPTR\_EL2, and CPTR\_EL3 registers, and the current Security state and Exception level, an attempt to execute the instruction might be trapped.

It has encodings from 2 classes: Half-precision and Single-precision and double-precision

## Half-precision

## (FEAT\_AdvSIMD &amp;&amp; FEAT\_FP16)

<!-- image -->

## Encoding

```
FMIN <Vd>.<T>, <Vn>.<T>, <Vm>.<T>
```

## Decode for this encoding

```
if !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_AdvSIMD) || !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_FP16) then EndOfDecode(Decode_UNDEF); constant integer d = UInt(Rd); constant integer n = UInt(Rn); constant integer m = UInt(Rm); constant integer esize = 16; constant integer datasize = 64 << UInt(Q); constant integer elements = datasize DIV esize;
```

Single-precision and double-precision

(FEAT\_AdvSIMD)

<!-- image -->

## Encoding

```
FMIN <Vd>.<T>, <Vn>.<T>, <Vm>.<T>
```

## Decode for this encoding

```
if !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_AdvSIMD) then EndOfDecode(Decode_UNDEF); if sz:Q == '10' then EndOfDecode(Decode_UNDEF); constant integer d = UInt(Rd); constant integer n = UInt(Rn); constant integer m = UInt(Rm); constant integer esize = 32 << UInt(sz); constant integer datasize = 64 << UInt(Q); constant integer elements = datasize DIV esize;

## Operation

```
AArch64.CheckFPAdvSIMDEnabled(); constant bits(datasize) operand1 = constant bits(datasize) operand2 = bits(datasize) result; bits(esize) element1;
```

```
V[n, datasize]; V[m, datasize]; bits(esize) element2;
```

<!-- image -->

&lt;Vn&gt;

```
for e = 0 to elements-1 element1 = Elem[operand1, e, esize]; element2 = Elem[operand2, e, esize]; Elem[result, e, esize] = FPMin(element1, element2, FPCR); V[d, datasize] = result;
