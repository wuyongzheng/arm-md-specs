## C8.2.273 FSUBR (immediate)

Floating-point reversed subtract from immediate (predicated)

This instruction reverse subtracts from an immediate each active floating-point element of the source vector, and destructively places the results in the corresponding elements of the source vector. The immediate may take the value +0.5 or +1.0 only. Inactive elements in the destination vector register remain unmodified.

## SVE

(FEAT\_SVE || FEAT\_SME)

## Encoding

```
FSUBR <Zdn>.<T>, <Pg>/M,
```

## Decode for this encoding

```
if !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_SVE) && !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_SME) then EndOfDecode(Decode_UNDEF); if size == '00' then EndOfDecode(Decode_UNDEF); constant integer esize = 8 << UInt(size); constant integer g = UInt(Pg); constant integer dn = UInt(Zdn); constant bits(esize) imm = if i1 == '0' then FPPointFive('0', esize) else FPOne('0', esize);
```

## Assembler Symbols

## &lt;Zdn&gt;

Is the name of the source and destination scalable vector register, encoded in the 'Zdn' field.

## &lt;Pg&gt;

```
<Zdn>.<T>, <const>
```

Is the size specifier, encoded in 'size':

|   size | <T>      |
|--------|----------|
|     00 | RESERVED |
|     01 | H        |
|     10 | S        |
|     11 | D        |

Is the name of the governing scalable predicate register P0-P7, encoded in the 'Pg' field.

## &lt;const&gt;

Is the floating-point immediate value, encoded in 'i1':

## Operation

```
CheckSVEEnabled(); constant integer VL = CurrentVL; constant integer PL = VL DIV 8; constant integer elements = VL DIV esize; constant bits(PL) mask = P[g, PL]; constant bits(VL) operand1 = Z[dn, VL]; bits(VL) result; for e = 0 to elements-1 constant bits(esize) element1 = Elem[operand1, e, esize]; if ActivePredicateElement(mask, e, esize) then Elem[result, e, esize] = FPSub(imm, element1, FPCR); else Elem[result, e, esize] = element1; Z[dn, VL] = result;
```

## Operational Information

This instruction might be immediately preceded in program order by a MOVPRFX instruction. The MOVPRFX must conform to all of the following requirements, otherwise the behavior of the MOVPRFX and this instruction is CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE:

- The MOVPRFX can be predicated or unpredicated.
- Apredicated MOVPRFX must use the same governing predicate register as this instruction.
- Apredicated MOVPRFX must use the larger of the destination element size and first source element size in the preferred disassembly of this instruction.
- The MOVPRFX must specify the same destination register as this instruction.
- The destination register must not refer to architectural register state referenced by any other source operand register of this instruction.

|------|-----------|
|    0 | #0.5      |
|    1 | #1.0      |
