## K10.1 Use of the Advanced SIMD complex number instructions

FEAT\_FCMA provides instructions to aid floating-point computations of complex numbers. This section illustrates the use of these instructions for complex arithmetic. It is not part of the Arm architecture definition.

This section uses the AArch64 instructions FCADD and FCMLA - usage of the AArch32 instructions VCADD and VCMLA is similar.

When using the instructions implemented by FEAT\_FCMA, a complex number is represented in a SIMD&amp;FP register as a pair of adjacent elements, each holding a floating-point number, with the more significant element holding the imaginary part of the number and the less significant element holding the real part of the number.

## K10.1.1 Complex addition

Simple complex addition on a vector of complex numbers is already provided by the vector form of the FADD instruction.

The functionality that FCADD adds is to rotate each complex number in the second vector by 90 degrees or 270 degrees counterclockwise (considering the complex numbers on an Argand diagram) before performing the addition. Mathematically, this is equivalent to multiplying the second complex number by i or -i before addition.

This means, given a complex number z stored in a pair of elements in one vector, and a complex number w stored in the corresponding element pair in another vector:

- FADD calculates z + w.
- FCADD calculates z ± iw.

## K10.1.2 Complex multiplication

The FCMLA instruction does not provide functionality for complex multiplication directly. However, a pair of FCMLA instructions can provide this function.

The FCMLA instruction operates on corresponding pairs of complex numbers stored in SIMD&amp;FP vector registers, and adds the result to the corresponding complex number in the destination SIMD&amp;FP vector register. This computation is as follows:

1. The second complex number is rotated by 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees counterclockwise.
2. That complex number is multiplied by either the real or imaginary part of the first complex number:
- When the rotation is 0 or 180 degrees, the real part is used.
- When the rotation is 90 or 270 degrees, the imaginary part is used.
3. The resulting complex number is added to the corresponding complex number in the destination register.

Mathematically, considering the complex numbers on an Argand diagram:

- Rotation by 180 degrees is equivalent to negation.
- Rotation by 90 degrees is equivalent to multiplying by i.
- Rotation by 270 degrees is equivalent to multiplying by -i.

This means that, for a first complex number z, where z = a+bi, and a second complex number w, if initially the corresponding complex number in the destination register is zero:

- When the rotation is 0 degrees the result of the multiply-add is aw.
- When the rotation is 180 degrees, the result is -aw.
- When the rotation is 90 degrees, the result is biw.
- When the rotation is 270 degrees, the result is -biw.

This means that, if the destination register is zeroed and an FCMLA instruction is executed with a rotation parameter of 0, and then the same instruction is executed with a rotation parameter of 90:

- The first execution returns aw in the destination register.

- The second execution accumulates biw to this, meaning the result is aw+biw.
- This result is the product of (a+bi)w, which is the product zw.

So, this pair of instructions can be used to implement complex multiplication.

After zeroing V0, the syntax of a pair of instructions to perform this complex number multiplication might be:

```
FCMLA V0.4S, V1.4S, V2.4S, #0 FCMLA V0.4S, V1.4S, V2.4S, #90
```

Other simple pairs of FCMLA instructions perform useful computations. For example, considering a first complex number z and second complex number w, defined as before, and a destination register that has been zeroed before the first FCMLA instruction is executed:

1. The following pair of instructions calculates the complex conjugate of z multiplied by w.
2. The following pair of instructions calculates the negation of z multiplied by w.

```
FCMLA V0.4S, V1.4S, V2.4S, #0 FCMLA V0.4S, V1.4S, V2.4S, #270
```

FCMLA V0.4S, V1.4S, V2.4S, #180

FCMLA V0.4S, V1.4S, V2.4S, #270

3. The following pair of instructions calculates the negation of the complex conjugate of z multiplied by w.

FCMLA V0.4S, V1.4S, V2.4S, #180

FCMLA

```
V0.4S, V1.4S, V2.4S, #90
```

Note

For these examples, the following caveats must be considered:

- FCMLA performs a fused multiply-add, meaning there is no intermediate rounding. This lack of intermediate rounding can give unexpected results in some cases. Arm expects that these instructions are only used in situations where the effect of the rounding of these results is not material to the calculation.
- When using the FCMLA instructions, the behavior of ( ∞ + ∞ i) multiplied by (0+i) is (NaN+NaNi), rather than the result expected by ISO C, which is complex ∞ .
