## H4.1 Introduction

The Debug Communications Channel , DCC, is a channel for passing data between the PE and an external agent, such as a debugger. The DCC provides a communications channel between:

- An external debugger, described as the debug host .
- The debug implementation on the PE, described as the debug target .

The DCC can be used:

- As a 32-bit full-duplex channel.
- As a 64-bit half-duplex channel.

The DCC is an essential part of Debug state operation and can also be used in Non-debug state.

The Instruction Transfer Register , ITR, passes instructions to the PE to execute in Debug state.

The PE includes flow-control mechanisms for both the DCC and ITR.
