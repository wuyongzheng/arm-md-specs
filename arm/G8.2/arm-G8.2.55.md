## G8.2.55 FPSCR, Floating-Point Status and Control Register

The FPSCR characteristics are:

## Purpose

Provides floating-point system status information and control.

## Configuration

It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether the Len and Stride fields can be programmed to nonzero values, which will cause some AArch32 floating-point instruction encodings to be UNDEFINED, or whether these fields are RAZ.

Implemented only if the implementation includes the Advanced SIMD and floating-point functionality.

AArch32 System register FPSCR bits [31:27] are architecturally mapped to AArch64 System register FPSR[31:27].

AArch32 System register FPSCR bit [7] is architecturally mapped to AArch64 System register FPSR[7].

AArch32 System register FPSCR bits [4:0] are architecturally mapped to AArch64 System register FPSR[4:0].

AArch32 System register FPSCR bits [26:15] are architecturally mapped to AArch64 System register FPCR[26:15].

AArch32 System register FPSCR bits [12:8] are architecturally mapped to AArch64 System register FPCR[12:8].

This register is present only when FEAT\_AA32 is implemented. Otherwise, direct accesses to FPSCR are UNDEFINED.

## Attributes

FPSCR is a 32-bit register.

## AHP, bit [26]

Alternative half-precision control bit:

|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0b0  | NaN operands propagate through to the output of a floating-point operation. |
| 0b1  | Any operation involving one or more NaNs returns the Default NaN.           |

The value of this bit controls only scalar floating-point arithmetic. Advanced SIMD arithmetic always uses the Default NaN setting, regardless of the value of the DN bit.
