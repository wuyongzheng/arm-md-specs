## E2.4 Ordering of translation table walks

If FEAT\_ETS2 is implemented, then an Effect E1 is Ordered-before an Effect E2 when all of the following apply:

- E1 is not generated by an Advanced SIMD or floating-point instruction.
- E2 is not generated for an instruction fetch.
- E1 is an Explicit Memory Effect.
- E1 appears in program order before E3.
- E3 is a TLBUncacheable Fault Effect.
- E2 is Translation-intrinsically-before E3.
- E2 is an Implicit TTD Memory Read Effect.

The full definition of the ordering implications of FEAT\_ETS2 is covered formally in Ordering requirements defined by the formal concurrency model, and the rules in this section are not intended to contradict that section.

For more information about ordering requirements to FEAT\_ETS2, see DSB-ordered-before and ETS-ordered-before.

If FEAT\_ETS3 is implemented, then an Effect E1 is Ordered-before an Effect E2 when all of the following apply:

- E1 is not generated by an Advanced SIMD or floating-point instruction.
- E2 is not generated for an instruction fetch.
- E1 is an Explicit Memory Effect.
- E1 appears in program order before E3.
- E3 is an MMU Fault Effect.
- E2 is Translation-intrinsically-before E3.
- E2 is an Implicit TTD Memory Read Effect.
