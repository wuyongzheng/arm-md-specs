## Appendix K5 Recommended External Debug Interface

This appendix describes the recommended external debug interface. It contains the following sections:

- About the recommended external debug interface.

- PMUEVENTbus.

- Recommended authentication interface.

- Management registers and CoreSight compliance.

Note

This recommended external debug interface specification is not part of the Arm architecture specification. Implementers and users of the architecture must not consider this appendix as a requirement of the architecture. It is included as an appendix to this manual only:

- As reference material for users of Arm products that implement this interface.

- As an example of how an external debug interface might be implemented.

The inclusion of this appendix is no indication of whether any Arm products might, or might not, implement this external debug interface. For details of the implemented external debug interface, you must always see the appropriate product documentation.
