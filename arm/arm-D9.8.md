## D9.8 Explicit PAS control

| I HHZGR   | The APAS instruction provides an architected mechanism for directly programming the PA space association for regions of memory that support memory-side dynamic PA space association. For example, this might be needed for memory expansion devices that maintain a local association between PA and PA space at cache-line granularity.                                                                                                                                                                                |

| R LGVKV   | If FEAT_RME_GPC3 is implemented, then an APAS Xt instruction is defined, which can be used to set the PA space of specific memory locations that are sensitive to the instruction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| R XDGGD   | It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED which regions of memory support the APAS instruction. For regions that support the APAS instruction, the following are also IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED: • The supported PA spaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| R BGQNC   | The granularity that an APAS instruction applies to is an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED naturally-aligned value that is at least 64 bytes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| I DQJHQ   | If the Target Attributes field is non-zero then the instruction might indicate a granularity larger than 64B.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| I CDCDK   | Arm expects that if APAS is issued to a location that does not support the APAS instruction, or to a location that cannot be associated with the indicated PA space, then the instruction has no effect on the location and does not generate an External abort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| R JYZRN   | An APAS instruction is permitted, but not required, to change the contents of the affected locations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| R JHVFK   | An APAS instruction has the same ordering behavior as VA-based cache maintenance instructions issued to the Outer Shareable shareability domain. See Ordering and completion of data and instruction cache instructions for more information. This includes aspects relating to the minimum size of cache lines, indicated by CTR_EL0.DminLine. Completion of a DSB SY guarantees that the effects of an APAS instruction are observable by all observers inside and outside of the Outer Shareable shareability domain. |
| I VQTWW   | The APAS instruction is UNDEFINED at EL2 and below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| R NZVRX   | The APAS instruction is not subject to granule protection checks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
