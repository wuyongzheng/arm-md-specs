## K10.8 Example OS Save and Restore sequences

This appendix provides possible OS Save and Restore sequences for a Debug implementation using the V8A or later architectures. It contains the following sections:

- Save Debug registers.
- Restore Debug registers.

## K10.8.1 Save Debug registers

This section shows how to save the registers that are used by an external debugger.

```
; On entry, X0 points to a block to save the debug registers in. ; Returns the pointer beyond the block and corrupts X1-X3 SaveDebugRegisters ; (1) Set OS Lock. MOV X2,#1 ; Set the OS Lock. In AArch64 state, the OS Lock MSR OSLAR_EL1,X2 ; is writable via OSLAR. ISB ; Context synchronization event ; (2) Walk through the registers, saving them MRS X1,OSDTRRX_EL1 ; Read DTRRX MRS X2,OSDTRTX_EL1 ; Read DTRTX STP W1,W2,[X0],#8 ; Save { DTRRX, DTRTX } MRS X1,OSECCR_EL1 ; Read ECCR MRS X2,MDSCR_EL1 ; Read DSCR STP W1,W2,[X0],#8 ; Save { ECCR, DSCR } [ AARCH32_SUPPORTED MRS X1,DBGVCR32_EL2 ; Read DBGVCR MRS X2,DBGCLAIMCLR_EL1 ; Read CLAIM -note, have to read via CLAIMCLR STP W1,W2,[X0],#8 ; Save { VCR, CLAIM } ] ;; Macros for saving off a "register pair" ;; $WB is W for watchpoint, B for breakpoint ;; $num is the pair's number ;; X0 contains a pointer for the value words ;; X1 contains a pointer for the control words ;; W2 contains the max index MACRO SaveRP $WB,$num, $exit MRS X3,DBG$WB.VR$num._EL1 ; Read DBGxVRn STR X3,[X0],#8 ; Save { xVRn } MRS X3,DBG$WB.CR$num._EL1 ; Read DBGxCRn STR W3,[X0],#4 ; Save { xCRn }. [ $num > 1 :LAND: $num < 15 CMP W1,#$num BEQ $exit ] MEND ; (3) Breakpoints MRS X1,ID_AA64DFR0_EL1 UBFX W1,W1,#12,#4 ; Extract BRPs field MACRO SaveBRP $num ; Save a Breakpoint Register Pair SaveRP B,$num,SaveDebugRegisters_Watchpoints MEND SaveBRP 0 SaveBRP 1 SaveBRP 2 ;; and so on to ... SaveBRP 15
```

```
SaveDebugRegisters_Watchpoints ; (4) Watchpoints MRS X1,ID_AA64DFR0_EL1 ; Read DBGDIDR UBFX W1,W1,#20,#4 ; Extract WRPs field MACRO SaveWRP $num ; Save a Watchpoint Register Pair SaveRP W,$num,SaveDebugRegisters_Exit MEND SaveWRP 0 SaveWRP 1 SaveWRP 2 ;; and so on to ... SaveWRP 15 SaveDebugRegisters_Exit ; (5) Return the pointer to first word not read. This pointer is already in X0, so ; all that is needed is to return from this function. The OS double-lock (OSDLR_EL1.DLK) is ; locked later, just before the final entry to WFI state. RET
```

## K10.8.2 Restore Debug registers

This section shows how to restore the registers that are used by an external debugger.

```
; On entry, X0 points to a block of saved debug registers. ; Returns the pointer beyond the block and corrupts R1-R3,R12. RestoreDebugRegisters ; (1) Lock OS Lock. The lock will already be set, but this write is included to ensure it ; is locked. MOV X2,#1 ; Lock the OS Lock. In AArch64 state, the OS Lock MSR OSLAR_EL1,X2 ; is writable via OSLAR. ISB ; Context synchronization event MSR MDSCR_EL1, XZR ; Initialize MDSCR_EL1 ; (2) Walk through the registers, restoring them LDP W1,W2,[X0],#8 ; Read { DTRRX,DTRTX } MSR OSDTRRX_EL1,X1 ; Restore DTRRX MSR OSDTRTX_EL1,X2 ; Restore DTRTX LDP W1,W3,[X0],#8 ; Read { DSCR, ECCR } MSR OSECCR_EL1,X2 ; Restore ECCR [ AARCH32_SUPPORTED LDP W1,W2,[X0],#8 ; Read { VCR,CLAIM } MSR DBGVCR32_EL2,X1 ; Restore DBGVCR MSR DBGCLAIMSET_EL1,X2 ; Restore CLAIM - note, writes CLAIMSET ] ;; Macro for restoring a "register pair" MACRO RestoreRP $WB,$num,$exit LDR X3,[X0],#8 ; Read { xVRn } MSR DBG$WB.VR$num._EL1,X3 ; Restore DBGxVRn LDR W3,[X0],#4 ; Read { xCRn } MSR DBG$WB.CR$num._EL1,X3 ; Restore DBGxCRn [ $num >= 1 :LAND: $num < 15 CMP W1,#$num BEQ $exit ] MEND ; (3) Breakpoints MRS X1,ID_AA64DFR0_EL1 UBFX W1,W1,#12,#4 ; Extract BRPs field
```

```
MACRO RestoreBRP $num ; Restore a Breakpoint Register Pair RestoreRP B,$num,RestoreDebugRegisters_Watchpoints MEND RestoreBRP 0 RestoreBRP 1 RestoreBRP 2 ;; and so on until ... RestoreBRP 15 RestoreDebugRegisters_Watchpoints ; (4) Watchpoints MRS X1,ID_AA64DFR0_EL1 ; Read DBGDIDR UBFX W1,W1,#20,#4 ; Extract WRPs field MACRO RestoreWRP $num ; Restore a Watchpoint Register Pair RestoreRP W,$num,RestoreDebugRegisters_Exit MEND RestoreWRP 0 RestoreWRP 1 RestoreWRP 2 ;; and so on until ... RestoreWRP 15 RestoreDebugRegisters_Exit MSR MDSCR_EL1, X3 ; Restore DSCR ; (5) Clear the OS Lock. ISB MOV X2,#0 ; Clear the OS Lock. In AArch64 state, the OS Lock MSR OSLAR_EL1,X2 ; is writable via OSLAR. ; (6) A final ISB guarantees the restored register values are visible to subsequent ; instructions. ISB ; (7) Return the pointer to first word not read. This pointer is already in X0, so ; all that is needed is to return from this function. RET

## Appendix K11 Barrier Litmus Tests

This appendix gives examples of the use of the barrier instructions provided by the Arm architecture. It contains the following sections:

- Introduction.
- Load-Acquire, Store-Release and barriers.
- Load-Acquire Exclusive, Store-Release Exclusive and barriers.
- Using a mailbox to send an interrupt.
- Cache and TLB maintenance instructions and barriers.
