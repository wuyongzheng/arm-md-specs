## K5.2 PMUEVENT bus

The PMUEVENT bus exports Performance Monitor events from the PE to an on-chip agent. Arm recommends that it has the following characteristics:

- The bus is synchronous.
- The width of the bus is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.
- It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED which events are exported on the bus.
- Each exported event occupies a contiguous sub-field of the bus. Arm recommends that the sub-fields of the bus are occupied in the same order as the event numbers.
- If the event can only occur once per cycle, it occupies a single bit. If the event can occur more than once per cycle, it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED how the event is encoded. The encoding depends on constraints such as the designated use of the event bus and the number of pins available. For example, the event can be encoded:
- -As a count, using a plain binary number. This is the most useful encoding when exporting to an external counter. It is not a useful encoding for exporting to a Trace extension external input.
- -As a count, using thermometer encoding. This is the most useful encoding when exporting to a Trace extension.
- -Using a single bit encoding to indicate whether the event count is zero or nonzero. This is useful for exporting to an activity monitor where the number of pins is constrained.

If an ETMv4 Trace extension is implemented, the PMUEVENT bus is normally connected to the Trace extension using the external inputs. TRCEXTINSELR multiplexes a wide PMUEVENT bus to a narrow set of inputs. An external PMUEVENT bus might also be provided. For more information, contact Arm.

When FEAT\_ETE is implemented, PMU events are connected to the trace unit, however the PMUEVENT bus is not used to connect the PMU events to the trace unit. See External inputs.
