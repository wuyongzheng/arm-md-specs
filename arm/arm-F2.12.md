## F2.12 Advanced SIMD and floating-point register transfer instructions

Table F2-19 summarizes the SIMD and floating-point register file transfer instructions in the Advanced SIMD and floating-point instruction sets. These instructions transfer data between the general-purpose registers and the registers in the SIMD and floating-point register file.

Advanced SIMD vectors, and single-precision and double-precision floating-point registers, are all views of the same register file. For details, see The SIMD and floating-point register file.
