## C8.2.377 LD4D (scalar plus immediate)

Contiguous load four-doubleword structures to four vectors (immediate index)

This instruction performs a contiguous load of four-doubleword structures, each to the same element number in four vector registers from the memory address generated by a 64-bit scalar base and an immediate index that is a multiple of 4 in the range -32 to 28 that is multiplied by the vector's in-memory size, irrespective of predication.

Each predicate element applies to the same element number in each of the four vector registers, or equivalently to the four consecutive doublewords in memory that make up each structure. Inactive elements will not cause a read from Device memory or signal a fault, and the corresponding element is set to zero in each of the four destination vector registers.

## Encoding

```
LD4D { <Zt1>.D, <Zt2>.D, <Zt3>.D, <Zt4>.D }, <Pg>/Z, [<Xn|SP>{, #<imm>, MUL
```

## Decode for this encoding

```
if !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_SVE) && !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_SME) then EndOfDecode(Decode_UNDEF); constant integer t = UInt(Zt); constant integer n = UInt(Rn); constant integer g = UInt(Pg); constant integer esize = 64; constant integer offset = SInt(imm4); constant integer nreg = 4;
