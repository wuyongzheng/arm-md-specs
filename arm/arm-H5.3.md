## H5.3 Cross-triggers on a PE in an Arm A-profile implementation

An A-Profile PE must include a Cross-Trigger interface, and the implementation must include at least the input and output triggers defined in this architecture. The number of channels in the Cross-Trigger matrix is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED, but there must be a minimum of three. Software can read CTIDEVID.NUMCHAN to discover the number of implemented channels.

The CTM must connect to all PEs in the same Inner Shareability domain as the PE that includes the Cross-Trigger interface, but can also connect to additional PEs. Arm strongly recommends that the CTM connects all PEs implementing a CTI in the system. This includes other PEs that can be connected using a CoreSight CTI module.

Note

In a uniprocessor system the CTM is OPTIONAL. In a multiprocessor system the CTM is required. The CTM might be connected other CTI modules for non-PEs, such as triggers for system visibility components. Arm recommends that the CTMis implemented.

Any CTI connected to a PE that is not an Arm PE must implement at least:

- The Debug request trigger event.
- The Restart trigger event.
- The Cross-halt trigger event.

For more information about the CTI, see the CoreSight™ SoC Technical Reference Manual . Arm architecture refines the generic CTI by defining roles for each of the implemented input and output triggers.
