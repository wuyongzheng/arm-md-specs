## C9.2.84 FMAXNM (multiple vectors)

Multi-vector floating-point maximum number

This instruction determines the maximum number value of floating-point elements of the two or four second source vectors and the corresponding floating-point elements of the two or four first source vectors and destructively places the results in the corresponding elements of the two or four first source vectors.

Regardless of the value of FPCR.AH, the behavior is as follows:

- Negative zero compares less than positive zero.
- If one element is numeric and the other is a quiet NaN, the result is the numeric value.
- When FPCR.DN is 0, if either element is a signaling NaN or if both elements are NaNs, the result is a quiet NaN.
- When FPCR.DN is 1, if either element is a signaling NaN or if both elements are NaNs, the result is Default NaN.

This instruction follows SME2 floating-point numerical behaviors corresponding to instructions that place their results in one or more SVE Z vectors.

This instruction is unpredicated.

It has encodings from 2 classes: Two registers and Four registers

Two registers

(FEAT\_SME2)

## Encoding

```
FMAXNM { <Zdn1>.<T>-<Zdn2>.<T> }, { <Zdn1>.<T>-<Zdn2>.<T> }, { <Zm1>.<T>-<Zm2>.<T> }
```

## Decode for this encoding

```
if !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_SME2) then EndOfDecode(Decode_UNDEF); constant integer esize = 8 << UInt(size); constant integer dn = UInt(Zdn:'0'); constant integer m = UInt(Zm:'0'); constant integer nreg = 2;
```

## Four registers

(FEAT\_SME2)

## Encoding

```
FMAXNM { <Zdn1>.<T>-<Zdn4>.<T> }, { <Zdn1>.<T>-<Zdn4>.<T> }, { <Zm1>.<T>-<Zm4>.<T> }
```

## Decode for this encoding

```
if !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_SME2) then EndOfDecode(Decode_UNDEF); constant integer esize = 8 << UInt(size); constant integer dn = UInt(Zdn:'00'); constant integer m = UInt(Zm:'00'); constant integer nreg = 4;
```
