## D24.2.32 CCSIDR\_EL1, Current Cache Size ID Register

The CCSIDR\_EL1 characteristics are:

## Purpose

Provides information about the architecture of the currently selected cache.

## Configuration

The implementation includes one CCSIDR\_EL1 for each cache that it can access. CSSELR\_EL1 selects which Cache Size ID Register is accessible.

AArch64 System register CCSIDR\_EL1 bits [31:0] are architecturally mapped to AArch32 System register CCSIDR[31:0].

AArch64 System register CCSIDR\_EL1 bits [63:32] are architecturally mapped to AArch32 System register CCSIDR2[31:0].

This register is present only when FEAT\_AA64 is implemented. Otherwise, direct accesses to CCSIDR\_EL1 are UNDEFINED.

## Attributes

CCSIDR\_EL1 is a 64-bit register.

## Field descriptions

When FEAT\_CCIDX is implemented:

| 63   | 56 55         | 32       |
|------|---------------|----------|
| RES0 | NumSets       |          |
| 31   | 24 23         | 2 0      |
| RES0 | Associativity | LineSize |

Note

The parameters NumSets, Associativity, and LineSize in these registers define the architecturally visible parameters that are required for the cache maintenance by Set/Way instructions. They are not guaranteed to represent the actual microarchitectural features of a design. You cannot make any inference about the actual sizes of caches based on these parameters.

## Bits [63:56]

Reserved, RES0.

## NumSets, bits [55:32]

(Number of sets in cache) - 1, therefore a value of 0 indicates 1 set in the cache. The number of sets does not have to be a power of 2.

## Bits [31:24]

Reserved, RES0.

## Associativity, bits [23:3]

(Associativity of cache) - 1, therefore a value of 0 indicates an associativity of 1. The associativity does not have to be a power of 2.

## LineSize, bits [2:0]

(Log2(Number of bytes in cache line)) - 4. For example:

- For a line length of 16 bytes: Log2(16) = 4, LineSize entry = 0. This is the minimum line length.
- For a line length of 32 bytes: Log2(32) = 5, LineSize entry = 1.

Note

The C++ 17 specification has two defined parameters relating to the granularity of memory that does not interfere. For generic software and tools, Arm will set the hardware\_destructive\_interference\_size parameter to 256 bytes and the hardware\_constructive\_interference\_size parameter to 64 bytes.

When FEAT\_MTE2 is implemented, where a cache only holds Allocation tags, this field is RES0.

## Otherwise:

## Bits [63:32]

Reserved, RES0.

## Bits [31:28]

Reserved, UNKNOWN.

## NumSets, bits [27:13]

(Number of sets in cache) - 1, therefore a value of 0 indicates 1 set in the cache. The number of sets does not have to be a power of 2.

## Associativity, bits [12:3]

(Associativity of cache) - 1, therefore a value of 0 indicates an associativity of 1. The associativity does not have to be a power of 2.

## LineSize, bits [2:0]

(Log2(Number of bytes in cache line)) - 4. For example:

- For a line length of 16 bytes: Log2(16) = 4, LineSize entry = 0. This is the minimum line length.
- For a line length of 32 bytes: Log2(32) = 5, LineSize entry = 1.

## Accessing CCSIDR\_EL1

If CSSELR\_EL1.{TnD, Level, InD} is programmed to a cache level that is not implemented, then on a read of the CCSIDR\_EL1 the behavior is CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE, and can be one of the following:

- The CCSIDR\_EL1 read is treated as NOP.
- The CCSIDR\_EL1 read is UNDEFINED. If FEAT\_IDST is implemented, this is permitted to be reported with EC syndrome value 0x18 .
- The CCSIDR\_EL1 read returns an UNKNOWN value.

Accesses to this register use the following encodings in the System register encoding space:

MRS &lt;Xt&gt;, CCSIDR\_EL1

| op0   | op1   | CRn    | CRm    | op2   |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| 0b11  | 0b001 | 0b0000 | 0b0000 | 0b000 |
