## C8.2.736 ST3B (scalar plus immediate)

Contiguous store three-byte structures from three vectors (immediate index)

This instruction performs a contiguous store of three-byte structures, each from the same element number in three vector registers to the memory address generated by a 64-bit scalar base and an immediate index that is a multiple of 3 in the range -24 to 21 that is multiplied by the vector's in-memory size, irrespective of predication.

Each predicate element applies to the same element number in each of the three vector registers, or equivalently to the three consecutive bytes in memory that make up each structure. Inactive structures are not written to memory.

## Encoding

```
ST3B { <Zt1>.B, <Zt2>.B, <Zt3>.B }, <Pg>, [<Xn|SP>{, #<imm>, MUL
```

## Decode for this encoding

```
if !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_SVE) && !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_SME) then EndOfDecode(Decode_UNDEF); constant integer t = UInt(Zt); constant integer n = UInt(Rn); constant integer g = UInt(Pg); constant integer esize = 8; constant integer offset = SInt(imm4); constant integer nreg = 3;
```

## Assembler Symbols

## &lt;Zt1&gt;

Is the name of the first scalable vector register to be transferred, encoded in the 'Zt' field.

## &lt;Zt2&gt;

Is the name of the second scalable vector register to be transferred, encoded as 'Zt' plus 1 modulo 32.

## &lt;Zt3&gt;

Is the name of the third scalable vector register to be transferred, encoded as 'Zt' plus 2 modulo 32.

## &lt;Pg&gt;

Is the name of the governing scalable predicate register P0-P7, encoded in the 'Pg' field.

## &lt;Xn|SP&gt;

Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose base register or stack pointer, encoded in the 'Rn' field.

## &lt;imm&gt;

Is the optional signed immediate vector offset, a multiple of 3 in the range -24 to 21, defaulting to 0, encoded in the 'imm4' field.
