## C8.2.104 CMLA (vectors)

Complex integer multiply-add

This instruction multiplies the duplicated real components for rotations 0 and 180, or imaginary components for rotations 90 and 270, of the integral numbers in the first source vector by the corresponding complex number in the second source vector rotated by 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees in the direction from the positive real axis towards the positive imaginary axis, when considered in polar representation.

This instruction then adds the products to the corresponding components of the complex numbers in the addend vector, and destructively places the results in the corresponding elements of the addend vector. This instruction is unpredicated.

These transformations permit the creation of a variety of multiply-add and multiply-subtract operations on complex numbers by combining two of these instructions with the same vector operands but with rotations that are 90 degrees apart.

Each complex number is represented in a vector register as an even/odd pair of elements with the real part in the even-numbered element and the imaginary part in the odd-numbered element.

## Operational Information

This instruction is a data-independent-time instruction as described in About PSTATE.DIT.

|   rot | <const>   |
|-------|-----------|
|    00 | #0        |

This instruction might be immediately preceded in program order by a MOVPRFX instruction. The MOVPRFX must conform to all of the following requirements, otherwise the behavior of the MOVPRFX and this instruction is CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE:

- The MOVPRFX must be unpredicated.
- The MOVPRFX must specify the same destination register as this instruction.
- The destination register must not refer to architectural register state referenced by any other source operand register of this instruction.
