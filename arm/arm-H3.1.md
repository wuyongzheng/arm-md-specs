## H3.1 Introduction to Halting debug events

External debug defines Halting debug events. The following Halting debug events are available from the introduction of Armv8:

- Halting Step debug events.
- Halt Instruction debug event.
- Exception Catch debug event.
- External Debug Request debug event.
- OS Unlock Catch debug event.
- Reset Catch debug events.
- Software Access debug event.

If halting is allowed, a Halting debug event halts the PE. The PE enters Debug state.

In addition, breakpoints and watchpoints might halt the PE if halting is allowed. See Breakpoint and Watchpoint debug events. Because breakpoints and watchpoints can generate an exception or halt the PE, Breakpoint and Watchpoint debug events are not classified as Halting debug events.

For a definition of Debug state, see Debug State. For a definition of halting allowed, see Halting allowed and halting prohibited.

Debug state entry and debug event prioritization describes the behavior when multiple debug events are generated by an instruction.

See also Synchronization and Halting debug events.

Table H3-1 shows the behavior of Breakpoint, Watchpoint, and Halting debug events.

Table H3-1 Summary of debug events and possible outcomes
