## D9.5 GPT caching and invalidation

| R YJGPL   | All fetches of GPT information use Normal memory types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

IJJHVQ

The Arm architecture permits a range of TLB implementation styles, including TLB caching structures that store entries that combine information from stage 1 and stage 2 translation table entries.

GPT information is permitted to be cached in combination with information from stage 1 and stage 2 translation table entries, as long as the requirements for invalidation of GPT information by TLBI *PA* operations are met. For example:

- An implementation that caches GPT information separately from stage 1 and stage 2 information is only required to invalidate GPT information as a result of a TLBI *PA* operation.
- An implementation that caches entries that combine stage 2 OA information with GPT information must invalidate all such entries in response to a TLBI PAALLOS operation.
- An implementation that caches entries that combine information from stage 2 level 2 Table descriptors with GPT information must invalidate those entries in response to a TLBI *PA* operation that matches the next-level address of those level 2 Table descriptors. It is not required to invalidate those entries when a TLBI *PA* matches the PA that the level 2 descriptor was fetched from.

IXZTJV A TLBI RPA* instruction applies to TLB entries containing GPT information relating to the supplied PA range.

IZDVNB A TLBI PAALL* instruction applies to all TLB entries containing GPT information.

IBKJTM A TLBI PAALL* instruction also applies to any TLB entry derived from GPC configuration register fields that are permitted to be cached in a TLB.

IJQRVK The remaining instruction syntax is the same as for Armv8-A. This means:

- {R} is a specifier denoting range-based invalidation.
- {L} is an optional specifier that reduces the scope of the invalidation to cached GPT entries fetched from the final level of the GPT walk.
- {OS} specifies that the TLBI applies to all the TLBs in the Outer Shareable domain. TLBI *PA* operations without OS are only required to apply to the PE executing the operation.
- &lt;Xt&gt; specifies that the instruction takes an X register as an argument to pass additional information about the invalidation scope.

| R LRKLF   | For TLBI *PA* instructions, Outer Shareable scope is sufficient to affect all TLBs in the system.                                                                                            |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I SXTLQ   | The TLBI *PA* operations do not have an nXS qualifier and always behave as though they are issued without an nXS qualifier.                                                                  |
| I FRSHC   | The Arm architecture has IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED support for TLB lockdown, and the interaction between TLB lockdown and existing data TLB maintenance instructions is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED. |
| R BFXRL   | TLBI *PA* operations affect TLB entries containing GPT information regardless of any TLB lockdown configuration.                                                                             |
| I TMCTS   | The TLBI *PA* operations have the same rules for ordering, observability, and completion as all other TLBI instructions.                                                                     |
| I PLYZN   | The TLBI RPAOS instruction invalidates TLB entries containing GPT information from any level of the GPT walk relating to the supplied PA range.                                              |
| I VLLLY   | The TLBI RPALOS instruction invalidates TLB entries containing GPT information from the final level of the GPT walk relating to the supplied PA range.                                       |
| I ZZJVG   | Consistent with all other TLBI instructions, over-invalidation is permitted, and under-invalidation is not.                                                                                  |
