## C8.2.380 LD4H (scalar plus scalar)

Contiguous load four-halfword structures to four vectors (scalar index)

This instruction performs a contiguous load of four-halfword structures, each to the same element number in four vector registers from the memory address generated by a 64-bit scalar base and a 64-bit scalar index register scaled by the element size ( LSL option) and added to the base address. After each structure access the index value is incremented by four. The index register is not updated by the instruction.

Each predicate element applies to the same element number in each of the four vector registers, or equivalently to the four consecutive halfwords in memory that make up each structure. Inactive elements will not cause a read from Device memory or signal a fault, and the corresponding element is set to zero in each of the four destination vector registers.

## Encoding

```
LD4H { <Zt1>.H, <Zt2>.H, <Zt3>.H, <Zt4>.H }, <Pg>/Z, [<Xn|SP>, <Xm>, LSL
```

## Decode for this encoding

```
if !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_SVE) && !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_SME) then EndOfDecode(Decode_UNDEF); if Rm == '11111' then EndOfDecode(Decode_UNDEF); constant integer t = UInt(Zt); constant integer n = UInt(Rn); constant integer m = UInt(Rm); constant integer g = UInt(Pg); constant integer esize = 16; constant integer nreg = 4;
