## C9.2.117 FMOPS (widening)

Half-precision sum of outer products to single-precision, subtracting

This instruction works with a 32-bit element ZA tile.

This instruction widens the SVLS × 2 sub-matrix of half-precision values held in the first source vector to single-precision values and multiplies it by the widened 2 × SVLS sub-matrix of half-precision values in the second source vector to single-precision values.

Each source vector is independently predicated by a corresponding governing predicate. When a 16-bit source element is Inactive it is treated as having the value +0.0, but if both pairs of source vector elements that correspond to a 32-bit destination element contain Inactive elements, then the destination element remains unmodified.

The resulting SVLS × SVLS single-precision sum of outer products is then destructively subtracted from the single-precision destination tile. This is equivalent to performing a 2-way dot product and subtract from each of the destination tile elements.

Each 32-bit container of the first source vector holds 2 consecutive column elements of each row of a SVLS × 2 sub-matrix. Similarly, each 32-bit container of the second source vector holds 2 consecutive row elements of each column of a 2 × SVLS sub-matrix.

This instruction follows SME ZA-targeting floating-point behaviors.
