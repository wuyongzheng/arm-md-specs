## C9.2.86 FMIN (multiple vectors)

Multi-vector floating-point minimum

This instruction determines the minimum of floating-point elements of the two or four second source vectors and the corresponding floating-point elements of the two or four first source vectors and destructively places the results in the corresponding elements of the two or four first source vectors.

When FPCR.AH is 0, the behavior is as follows:

- Negative zero compares less than positive zero.
- When FPCR.DN is 0, if either element is a NaN, the result is a quiet NaN.
- When FPCR.DN is 1, if either element is a NaN, the result is Default NaN.

When FPCR.AH is 1, the behavior is as follows:

- If both elements are zeros, regardless of the sign of either zero, the result is the second element.
- If either element is a NaN, regardless of the value of FPCR.DN, the result is the second element.

This instruction follows SME2 floating-point numerical behaviors corresponding to instructions that place their results in one or more SVE Z vectors.

This instruction is unpredicated.

It has encodings from 2 classes: Two registers and Four registers

## Two registers

(FEAT\_SME2)

<!-- image -->

## Encoding

```
FMIN { <Zdn1>.<T>-<Zdn2>.<T> }, { <Zdn1>.<T>-<Zdn2>.<T> }, { <Zm1>.<T>-<Zm2>.<T> }
```

## Decode for this encoding

```
if !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_SME2) then constant integer esize = 8 << UInt(size); constant integer dn = UInt(Zdn:'0'); constant integer m = UInt(Zm:'0'); constant integer nreg = 2;
```

## Four registers

(FEAT\_SME2)

## Encoding

```
FMIN { <Zdn1>.<T>-<Zdn4>.<T> }, { <Zdn1>.<T>-<Zdn4>.<T> }, { <Zm1>.<T>-<Zm4>.<T> }
```

```

## Decode for this encoding

```
if !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_SME2) then EndOfDecode(Decode_UNDEF); constant integer esize = 8 << UInt(size); constant integer dn = UInt(Zdn:'00'); constant integer m = UInt(Zm:'00'); constant integer nreg = 4;
