## C9.2.257 STMOPA (2-way)

Signed 16-bit integer sparse sum of outer products to 32-bit integer, accumulating

This instruction generates signed integer sum of outer products by multiplying the 2-in-4 selected elements from the dense sub-matrices in the two first source vectors with the corresponding elements of the compressed sparse sub-matrix in the second source vector and accumulates the results to the corresponding elements of a 32-bit element ZA tile.

The sum of outer products is generated by multiplying the selected 2-in-4 16-bit signed values from each overlapping 32-bit containers of the two SVLS × 2 sub-matrices in the first source vectors by the two 16-bit signed values from the corresponding 32-bit container of the 2 × SVLS sub-matrix in the second source vector. The two selected elements from each overlapping 32-bit containers of the first source vectors correspond to 2-in-4 elements of rows of two SVLS × 2 sub-matrices. Each 32-bit container of the second source vector holds 2 elements of columns of a compressed 2 × SVLS sub-matrix.

The 2-in-4 16-bit signed values from overlapping 32-bit containers of the first source vectors are selected by 4-bit controls in the indexed segment of the control vector register. If the control bit corresponding to an element in the first source vectors is 0, the element is discarded and does not contribute to the sum of products result. If more than two bits of the 4-bit control corresponding to 32-bit containers of the first source vectors are 1, only the elements corresponding to the least two significant bits are selected.

The resulting SVLS × SVLS widened 32-bit integer sum of outer products is then destructively added to the 32-bit integer destination tile. This is equivalent to performing a 2-way dot product and accumulate to each of the destination tile elements.

This instruction is unpredicated.
