## A1.2 Architecture profiles

The Arm architecture has evolved significantly since its introduction, and Arm continues to develop it. Nine major versions of the architecture have been defined to date, denoted by the version numbers 1 to 9. Of these, the first three versions are now obsolete.

The generic names AArch64 and AArch32 describe the 64-bit and 32-bit Execution states:

AArch64

Is the 64-bit Execution state, meaning addresses are held in 64-bit registers, and instructions in the base instruction set can use 64-bit registers for their processing. AArch64 state supports the A64 instruction set.

AArch32

Note

The Base instruction set comprises the supported instructions other than the floating-point instructions.

See sections Execution state and The instruction sets for more information.

Arm defines three architecture profiles:

- A Application profile, described in this Manual:
- Supports a Virtual Memory System Architecture (VMSA) based on a Memory Management Unit (MMU).

Note

An Armv8-A implementation can be called an AArchv8-A implementation and an Armv9-A implementation can be called an AArchv9-A implementation.

- Supports the A64, A32, and T32 instruction sets.
- R Real-time profile:
- Supports a Protected Memory System Architecture (PMSA) based on a Memory Protection Unit (MPU).
- Supports an optional VMSA based on an MMU.
- Supports the A64, or the A32 and T32 instruction sets.
- M Microcontroller profile:
- Implements a programmers' model designed for low-latency interrupt processing, with hardware stacking of registers and support for writing interrupt handlers in high-level languages.
- Supports a PMSA based on an MPU.
- Supports a variant of the T32 instruction set.

This Manual describes only Armv8-A and Armv9-A. For information about the R and M architecture profiles, and earlier Arm architecture versions, see:

- The Arm ® Architecture Reference Manual Supplement - Armv8, for Armv8-R AArch64 architecture profile .
- The ARM ® Architecture Reference Manual Supplement - ARMv8, for the ARMv8-R AArch32 architecture profile .

- The Armv7-M Architecture Reference Manual .
- The ARMv6-M Architecture Reference Manual .

Is the 32-bit Execution state, meaning addresses are held in 32-bit registers, and instructions in the base instruction sets use 32-bit registers for their processing. AArch32 state supports the T32 and A32 instruction sets.
