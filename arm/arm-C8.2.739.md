## C8.2.739 ST3D (scalar plus scalar)

Contiguous store three-doubleword structures from three vectors (scalar index)

This instruction performs a contiguous store of three-doubleword structures, each from the same element number in three vector registers to the memory address generated by a 64-bit scalar base and a 64-bit scalar index register scaled by the element size ( LSL option) and added to the base address. After each structure access the index value is incremented by three. The index register is not updated by the instruction.

Each predicate element applies to the same element number in each of the three vector registers, or equivalently to the three consecutive doublewords in memory that make up each structure. Inactive structures are not written to memory.

## Encoding

```
ST3D { <Zt1>.D, <Zt2>.D, <Zt3>.D },
```

## Decode for this encoding

```
if !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_SVE) && !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_SME) then EndOfDecode(Decode_UNDEF); if Rm == '11111' then EndOfDecode(Decode_UNDEF); constant integer t = UInt(Zt); constant integer n = UInt(Rn); constant integer m = UInt(Rm); constant integer g = UInt(Pg); constant integer esize = 64; constant integer nreg = 3;
