## G8.2.8 APSR, Application Program Status Register

The APSR characteristics are:

## Purpose

Hold program status and control information.

Note

Some of the fields in this register are permitted to return the value of the PSTATE field on a read. This is an exception to the general rule that an UNKNOWN field must not return information that cannot be obtained, at the current Privilege level, by an architected mechanism.

For more information see 'The Application Program Status Register, APSR'.

## Configuration

This register is present only when FEAT\_AA32 is implemented. Otherwise, direct accesses to APSR are UNDEFINED.

## Attributes

APSR is a 32-bit register.

## Field descriptions

<!-- image -->

## N, bit [31]

Negative condition flag. Set to bit[31] of the result of the last flag-setting instruction. If the result is regarded as a two's complement signed integer, then N is set to 1 if the result was negative, and N is set to 0 if the result was positive or zero.

## Z, bit [30]

Zero condition flag. Set to 1 if the result of the last flag-setting instruction was zero, and to 0 otherwise. A result of zero often indicates an equal result from a comparison.

## C, bit [29]

Carry condition flag. Set to 1 if the last flag-setting instruction resulted in a carry condition, for example an unsigned overflow on an addition.

## V, bit [28]

Overflow condition flag. Set to 1 if the last flag-setting instruction resulted in an overflow condition, for example a signed overflow on an addition.

## Q, bit [27]

Cumulative saturation bit. Set to 1 to indicate that overflow or saturation occurred in some instructions.

## Bits [26:23]

Reserved, RES0.

## PAN, bit [22]

## When FEAT\_PAN is implemented:

Privileged Access Never. This field is UNKNOWN, but is permitted to return the value of PSTATE.PAN field. On writes, this field is treated as Do-Not-Modify.

The reset behavior of this field is:

- On a Warm reset, this field resets to an architecturally UNKNOWN value.

## Otherwise:

Reserved, RES0.

## Bits [21:20]

Reserved, RES0.

## GE, bits [19:16]

Greater than or Equal flags, for parallel addition and subtraction.

## Bits [15:10]

Reserved, RES0.

## E, bit [9]

Endianness. This field is UNKNOWN, but is permitted to return the value of PSTATE.E field. On writes, this field is treated as Do-Not-Modify.

The reset behavior of this field is:

- On a Warm reset, this field resets to an architecturally UNKNOWN value.

## A, bit [8]

SError exception mask. This field is UNKNOWN, but is permitted to return the value of PSTATE.A field. On writes, this field is treated as Do-Not-Modify.

The reset behavior of this field is:

- On a Warm reset, this field resets to an architecturally UNKNOWN value.

## I, bit [7]

IRQ interrupt mask. This field is UNKNOWN, but is permitted to return the value of PSTATE.I field. On writes, this field is treated as Do-Not-Modify.

The reset behavior of this field is:

- On a Warm reset, this field resets to an architecturally UNKNOWN value.

## F, bit [6]

FIQ interrupt mask. This field is UNKNOWN, but is permitted to return the value of PSTATE.F field. On writes, this field is treated as Do-Not-Modify.

The reset behavior of this field is:

- On a Warm reset, this field resets to an architecturally UNKNOWN value.

## Bit [5]

Reserved, RES0.

M[4:0], bits [4:0]

Mode. This field is UNKNOWN, but is permitted to return the value of PSTATE.M[4:0] field. On writes, this field is treated as Do-Not-Modify.

The reset behavior of this field is:

- On a Warm reset, this field resets to an architecturally UNKNOWN value.

## Accessing APSR

APSR can be read using the MRS instruction and written using the MSR (register) or MSR (immediate) instructions.
