## H6.3 Core power domain power states

The Arm architecture does not define the power states of the PE as these are not normally visible to software. However, they are visible to the external debugger. Arm A-profile external debug uses a four logical power states model for the Core power domain. Mechanisms for entering a low-power state describes the architectural mechanisms for entering low-power states.

When the PE enters a low-power state other than Powerdown by executing a WFI , WFIT , WFE , or WFET instruction, it remains in that low-power state until it receives a wakeup event. See Mechanisms for entering a low-power state for the definition of wakeup events. When halting is allowed, an External Debug Request is a wakeup event. In addition, if the PE enters the Standby state for any reason, it will leave that state to service an External Debug Request debug event.

The four logical power states are as follows:

- Normal

The Core power domain is fully powered up and the debug registers are accessible.

Standby

## Retention

## Powerdown

The Core power domain is on, but there are measures to reduce energy consumption. There can be other IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED measures the OS can take to enter standby.

The PE preserves the PE state, including the debug logic state. Changing from standby to normal operation does not involve a reset of the PE.

Standby is the least invasive OS energy saving state. Standby implies only that the PE is unavailable and does not clear any debug settings. For standby, the Debug architecture requires only the following:

- If the external debug interface is accessed, the PE must respond to that access. Arm recommends that, if the PE executed a WFI or WFE instruction to enter standby, then it does not retire that instruction.

Note

When FEAT\_WFxT is implemented, this also applies to the WFET and WFIT instructions.

Standby is transparent, meaning that to software and to an external debugger it is indistinguishable from normal operation.

The PE state, including debug settings, is preserved in low-power structures, allowing the Core power domain to be at least partially turned off.

Changing from low-power retention to normal operation does not involve a reset of the PE. The saved PE state is restored on changing from low-power retention state to normal operation. If software has to use an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED code sequence before entering, or after leaving, a retention state, this is referred to as a software-visible retention state . It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether the value of DBGPRCR.CORENPDRQ is set to its Cold reset value on leaving the software-visible retention state. See the description of DBGPRCR.CORENPDRQ for more information.

Note

- This model of retention does not include implementations where the PE exits the state in response to a debug register access. From the Debug architecture perspective, implementations like this are forms of standby.

These measures must include the OS saving any PE state, including the debug settings, that must be preserved over powerdown.

If FEAT\_DoubleLock is implemented, it is used during powerdown.

Changing from powerdown to normal operation must include:

- ACold reset of the PE after the power level has been restored.
- The OS restoring the saved PE state.

External Debug Request debug events stay pending and debug registers in the Core power domain cannot be accessed.

An implementation might support enabling and disabling threads, either dynamically or once at reset time. Threads that are disabled in this way must appear to the external debugger as either:

- Powered off, meaning they are either:

- In a powerdown state.

- In a retention state.

- Held in reset state.

Arm A-profile external debug uses a simpler two states model for the Debug power domain. The two states are:

Off

The Debug power domain is turned off.

On The Debug power domain is turned on.

The available power states, including the cross-product of Core power domain and Debug power domain power states is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED. Implementations are not required to implement all of these states and might include additional states. These additional states must appear to the debugger as one of the logical power states defined by this model. The control of power states is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.

Note

As a result, it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether it is possible for the Debug power domain to be on when the Core power domain is off.

If the Debug power domain is implemented but is not powered up when the Core power domain is powered up, the Reset Catch debug event and the OS Unlock Catch debug event are disabled.
