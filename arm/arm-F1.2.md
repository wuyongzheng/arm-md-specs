## F1.2 Standard assembler syntax fields

The following assembler syntax fields are standard across all or most instructions:

- &lt;c&gt; Is an optional field. It specifies the condition under which the instruction is executed. See Conditional execution for the range of available conditions and their encoding. If &lt;c&gt; is omitted, it defaults to always ( AL ).
- &lt;q&gt; Specifies optional assembler qualifiers on the instruction. The following qualifiers are defined:
- .N Meaning narrow, specifies that the assembler must select a 16-bit encoding for the instruction. If this is not possible, an assembler error is produced.
- .W Meaning wide, specifies that the assembler must select a 32-bit encoding for the instruction. If this is not possible, an assembler error is produced.

If neither .W nor .N is specified, the assembler can select either 16-bit or 32-bit encodings. If both are available, it must select a 16-bit encoding. In a few cases, more than one encoding of the same length can be available for an instruction. The rules for selecting between such encodings are instruction-specific and are part of the instruction description. The assembler syntax includes a mandatory .W qualifier, along with a note describing the cases in which it applies, where this qualifier is required to select a particular encoding for an instruction. Additional assembler syntax will describe the syntax when the conditions are not met.

Note

When assembling to the A32 instruction set, the .N qualifier produces an assembler error and the .W qualifier has no effect.
