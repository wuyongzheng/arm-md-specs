## C8.2.735 ST2W (scalar plus scalar)

Contiguous store two-word structures from two vectors (scalar index)

This instruction performs a contiguous store of two-word structures, each from the same element number in two vector registers to the memory address generated by a 64-bit scalar base and a 64-bit scalar index register scaled by the element size ( LSL option) and added to the base address. After each structure access the index value is incremented by two. The index register is not updated by the instruction.

Each predicate element applies to the same element number in each of the two vector registers, or equivalently to the two consecutive words in memory that make up each structure. Inactive structures are not written to memory.

## Encoding

```
ST2W { <Zt1>.S, <Zt2>.S }, <Pg>, [<Xn|SP>, <Xm>, LSL #2]
```

## Decode for this encoding

```
if !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_SVE) && !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_SME) then EndOfDecode(Decode_UNDEF); if Rm == '11111' then EndOfDecode(Decode_UNDEF); constant integer t = UInt(Zt); constant integer n = UInt(Rn); constant integer m = UInt(Rm); constant integer g = UInt(Pg); constant integer esize = 32; constant integer nreg = 2;

## Assembler Symbols

## &lt;Zt1&gt;

Is the name of the first scalable vector register to be transferred, encoded in the 'Zt' field.

## &lt;Zt2&gt;

Is the name of the second scalable vector register to be transferred, encoded as 'Zt' plus 1 modulo 32.

## &lt;Pg&gt;

Is the name of the governing scalable predicate register P0-P7, encoded in the 'Pg' field.

## &lt;Xn|SP&gt;

Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose base register or stack pointer, encoded in the 'Rn' field.

## &lt;Xm&gt;

Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose offset register, encoded in the 'Rm' field.
