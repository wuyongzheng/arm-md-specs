## G8.2.100 ID\_PFR1, Processor Feature Register 1

The ID\_PFR1 characteristics are:

## Purpose

Gives information about the AArch32 programmers' model.

Must be interpreted with ID\_PFR0.

For general information about the interpretation of the ID registers see 'Principles of the ID scheme for fields in ID registers'.

## Configuration

AArch32 System register ID\_PFR1 bits [31:0] are architecturally mapped to AArch64 System register ID\_PFR1\_EL1[31:0].

This register is present only when FEAT\_AA32EL1 is implemented. Otherwise, direct accesses to ID\_PFR1 are UNDEFINED.

## Attributes

ID\_PFR1 is a 32-bit register.
