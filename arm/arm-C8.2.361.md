## C8.2.361 LD2Q (scalar plus immediate)

Contiguous load two-quadword structures to two vectors (immediate index)

This instruction performs a contiguous load of two-quadword structures, each to the same element number in two vector registers from the memory address generated by a 64-bit scalar base and an immediate index that is a multiple of 2 in the range -16 to 14 that is multiplied by the vector's in-memory size, irrespective of predication.

Each predicate element applies to the same element number in each of the two vector registers, or equivalently to the two consecutive quadwords in memory that make up each structure. Inactive elements will not cause a read from Device memory or signal a fault, and the corresponding element is set to zero in each of the two destination vector registers.

## Encoding

```
LD2Q { <Zt1>.Q, <Zt2>.Q }, <Pg>/Z, [<Xn|SP>{, #<imm>, MUL
```

## Decode for this encoding

```
if !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_SVE2p1) && !IsFeatureImplemented(FEAT_SME2p1) then EndOfDecode(Decode_UNDEF); constant integer t = UInt(Zt); constant integer n = UInt(Rn); constant integer g = UInt(Pg); constant integer esize = 128; constant integer offset = SInt(imm4); constant integer nreg = 2;

## Assembler Symbols

## &lt;Zt1&gt;

Is the name of the first scalable vector register to be transferred, encoded in the 'Zt' field.

## &lt;Zt2&gt;

Is the name of the second scalable vector register to be transferred, encoded as 'Zt' plus 1 modulo 32.

## &lt;Pg&gt;

Is the name of the governing scalable predicate register P0-P7, encoded in the 'Pg' field.

## &lt;Xn|SP&gt;

Is the 64-bit name of the general-purpose base register or stack pointer, encoded in the 'Rn' field.

## &lt;imm&gt;

Is the optional signed immediate vector offset, a multiple of 2 in the range -16 to 14, defaulting to 0, encoded in the 'imm4' field.
