## F6.1.6 FSTMDBX, FSTMIAX

FSTMXstores multiple SIMD&amp;FP registers from the Advanced SIMD and floating-point register file to consecutive locations in using an address from a general-purpose register.

Arm deprecates use of FSTMDBX and FSTMIAX, except for disassembly purposes, and reassembly of disassembled code.

Depending on settings in the CPACR, NSACR, HCPTR, and FPEXC registers, and the Security state and PE mode in which the instruction is executed, an attempt to execute the instruction might be UNDEFINED, or trapped to Hyp mode. For more information, see Enabling Advanced SIMD and floating-point support.

It has encodings from the following instruction sets: A32 (A1) and T32 (T1).

## Encoding for the Decrement Before variant

```
Applies when (P == 1 && U == 0 && W == FSTMDBX{<c>}{<q>} <Rn>!, <dreglist>
```

## Encoding for the Increment After variant

```
Applies when (P == 0 && U == 1) FSTMIAX{<c>}{<q>} <Rn>{!}, <dreglist>
```

## Decode for all variants of this encoding

```
if P == '0' && U == '0' && W == '0' then SEE "Related encodings"; if P == '1' && W == '0' then SEE "VSTR"; if P == U && W == '1' then UNDEFINED; // Remaining combinations are PUW = 010 (IA without !), 011 (IA with !), 101 (DB with !) constant boolean single_regs = FALSE; constant boolean add = (U == '1'); constant boolean wback = (W == '1'); constant integer d = UInt(D:Vd); constant integer n = UInt(Rn); constant bits(32) imm32 = ZeroExtend(imm8:'00', 32); constant integer regs = UInt(imm8) DIV 2; // If UInt(imm8) is odd, see "FSTDBMX, FSTMIAX". if n == 15 && (wback || CurrentInstrSet() != InstrSet_A32) then UNPREDICTABLE; if regs == 0 || regs > 16 || (d+regs) > 32 then UNPREDICTABLE; if imm8<0> == '1' && (d+regs) > 16 then UNPREDICTABLE;
```

## CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE behavior

If regs == 0 , then one of the following behaviors must occur:

- The instruction is UNDEFINED.
- The instruction executes as NOP .
- The instruction operates as a VSTM with the same addressing mode but stores no registers.

If regs &gt; 16 || (d+regs) &gt; 16 , then one of the following behaviors must occur:

```

## CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE behavior

If regs == 0 , then one of the following behaviors must occur:

- The instruction is UNDEFINED.
- The instruction executes as NOP .
- The instruction operates as a VSTM with the same addressing mode but stores no registers.

If regs &gt; 16 || (d+regs) &gt; 16 , then one of the following behaviors must occur:

- The instruction is UNDEFINED.
- The instruction executes as NOP .
- The memory locations specified by the instruction and the number of registers specified by the instruction become UNKNOWN. If the instruction specifies writeback, then that register becomes UNKNOWN. This behavior does not affect any other memory locations.
- The instruction is UNDEFINED.
- The instruction executes as NOP .
- The memory locations specified by the instruction and the number of registers specified by the instruction become UNKNOWN. If the instruction specifies writeback, then that register becomes UNKNOWN. This behavior does not affect any other memory locations.

## Assembler Symbols

```
<c> See Standard assembler syntax fields. <q> See Standard assembler syntax fields.
```

## &lt;Rn&gt;

Is the general-purpose base register, encoded in the 'Rn' field. If writeback is not specified, the PC can be used. However, Arm deprecates use of the PC.

## &lt;dreglist&gt;

Is the list of consecutively numbered 64-bit SIMD&amp;FP registers to be transferred. The first register in the list is encoded in 'D:Vd', and 'imm8' is set to twice the number of registers in the list plus one. The list must contain at least one register, all registers must be in the range D0-D15, and must not contain more than 16 registers.

!

Specifies base register writeback, encoded in 'W':

## Operation

```
if ConditionPassed() then EncodingSpecificOperations(); CheckVFPEnabled(TRUE); bits(32) address = if add then R[n] else R[n]-imm32; for r = 0 to regs-1 if single_regs then MemA[address,4] = S[d+r]; address = address+4; else // Store as two word-aligned words in the correct order for current endianness. if BigEndian(AccessType_ASIMD) then MemA[address,4] = D[d+r]<63:32>; MemA[address+4,4] = D[d+r]<31:0>; else MemA[address,4] = D[d+r]<31:0>; MemA[address+4,4] = D[d+r]<63:32>; address = address+8; if wback then R[n] = if add then R[n]+imm32 else R[n]-imm32;
