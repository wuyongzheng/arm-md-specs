## D14.7 Synchronous events

Only events that count instructions at retirement can be synchronous events, but not all such events are required to be synchronous events.

An at-retirement event is an event generated by an architecturally-executed instruction that does not generate an exception.

Arm expects the set of synchronous events to include, but not be limited to:

- Existing events that count instructions at retirement:
- -INST\_RETIRED.
- -Events that count instructions based on a taxonomy of instruction types.
- -Other existing branch events that count branches at retirement based on their behavior during execution.
- Events that count retired instructions that missed or hit in the instruction TLB or cache.
- Events that count retired load instructions that missed or hit in the data TLB or cache.

Events that are not attributable to an instruction, or are attributable to an instruction that generates an exception, such as EXC\_TAKEN, are never synchronous events.

Note

Software requires a priori knowledge of which events are synchronous events. There is no hardware identification mechanism. A systematic software ID mechanism, such as a table in firmware, should be implemented.

If FEAT\_SEBEP is implemented, then the following events support synchronous mode:

- 0x0000 , SW\_INCR, Instruction architecturally executed, Condition code check pass, software increment.
- 0x0008 , INST\_RETIRED, Instruction architecturally executed.
- 0x000C , PC\_WRITE\_RETIRED, Instruction architecturally executed, Condition code check pass, Software change of the PC.
- 0x0021 , BR\_RETIRED, Instruction architecturally executed, branch.
- 0x0022 , BR\_MIS\_PRED\_RETIRED, Branch Instruction architecturally executed, mispredicted.

If FEAT\_SEBEP and FEAT\_BRBE are implemented, then the following event supports synchronous mode:

- 0x811F , BRB\_FILTRATE, Branch Record captured.

If FEAT\_SEBEP is implemented, then Arm recommends that the following events that count retired branches support synchronous mode:
