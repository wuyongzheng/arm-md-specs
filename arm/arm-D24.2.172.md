- When the highest implemented Exception level is EL3, this field resets to '0' .

## Otherwise:

Reserved, RES0.

## Bits [6:5]

Reserved, RES0.

## EnANERR, bit [4]

## When FEAT\_ANERR is implemented:

Enable Asynchronous Normal Read Error.

| EnANERR   | Meaning                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0b0       | External aborts on Normal memory reads generate synchronous Data Abort exceptions in the EL3 translation regime.                        |
| 0b1       | External aborts on Normal memory reads generate synchronous Data Abort or asynchronous SError exceptions in the EL3 translation regime. |

Implementation-specific exceptions to applications of this field are described in 'Taking error exceptions'.

Setting this field to 0 does not guarantee that the PE is able to take a synchronous Data Abort exception for an External abort on a Normal memory read in every case. There might be implementation-specific circumstances when an error on a load cannot be taken synchronously. These circumstances should be rare enough that treating such occurrences as fatal does not cause a significant increase in failure rate.

If FEAT\_SVE is implemented, SCTLR2\_EL3.EnANERR is 0, and the access generating the External abort is due to any Active element of an SVE Non-fault vector load instruction or an Active element that is not the First active element of an SVE First-fault vector load instruction, then no exception is generated and the External abort is reported in the FFR.

Setting this field to 0 might have a performance impact for Normal memory reads.

This field is ignored by the PE and treated as one when all of the following are true:

- FEAT\_ADERR is implemented.
- ID\_AA64MMFR3\_EL1.ANERR reads as 0b0010 .
- SCTLR2\_EL3.EnADERR is 1.

The reset behavior of this field is:

- On a Warm reset:
- When the highest implemented Exception level is EL3, this field resets to '0' .

## Otherwise:

Reserved, RES0.

## EnADERR, bit [3]

## When FEAT\_ADERR is implemented:

Enable Asynchronous Device Read Error.

| EnADERR   | Meaning                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0b0       | External aborts on Device memory reads generate synchronous Data Abort exceptions in the EL3 translation regime.                        |

| EMEC   | Meaning                                                 |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|
