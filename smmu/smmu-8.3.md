| 0b1111         | Response Failure | CMD_PRI_RESP with Resp == ResponseFailure • Software has determined that ATS is disabled for the stream, or some other (non-mapping-related) permanent failure. This response is returned for an auto-response on overflow where SMMU_IDR3.PPS == 0 and the associated request was supplied with a PASID and the SMMUis unable to locate a valid STE when checking STE.PPAR. This response is also returned for all incoming PPRs when any of the following conditions exist: • The effective value of PRIQEN == 0 (which might be because SMMU_CR0.SMMUEN == 0), • A GERROR.PRIQ_ABT_ERR error is active. • The PPR is received from a Secure stream. |
