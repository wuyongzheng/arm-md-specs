## 6.3 Register formats

In the following detailed register descriptions, there is information about behavior of accesses to each register. For each register, there is a subsection titled 'Accessing the register name '. This subsection in each register description follows the following format:

1. Optional introductory text, that might specify complex access behaviors.
2. A table describing the register page and offset of the register.
3. A simplified description of the register access behavior.

In all cases, the information in part 3 describes the behavior from SMMUv3.2 onwards. In some cases, the introductory text in part 1 includes additional, more-relaxed, behaviors that were permitted in SMMUv3.1 and earlier.
