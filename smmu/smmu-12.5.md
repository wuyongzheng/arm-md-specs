## 12.5 Confidential information in RAS Error Records

The RAS System Architecture [11] provides implementation requirements for RAS in system components using the Arm RAS architecture.

It also introduces the concept of Confidential Data for platforms with FEAT\_RME, and requirements on the content that can be recorded in RAS error record registers

In an SMMU with RME, the same requirements apply to RAS Error Record registers in that SMMU.
