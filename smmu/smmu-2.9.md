2.9. Permitted implementation of subsets of SMMUv3.x and SMMUv3.(x+1) architectural features

## 2.9 Permitted implementation of subsets of SMMUv3.x and SMMUv3.(x+1) architectural features

An SMMUv3.x compliant implementation can include any arbitrary subset of the architectural features of SMMUv3.(x+1), subject only to those constraints that require that certain features be implemented together.

An SMMUv3.x compliant implementation cannot include any features of SMMUv3.(x+2) or later. Arm strongly recommends that implementations use the latest version available at design time.
