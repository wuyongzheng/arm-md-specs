## B4.5.92 RMI\_VERSION command

Allows the Host and the RMM to determine whether there exists a mutually acceptable revision of the RMM via which the two components can communicate.

On calling this command, the Host provides a requested RMI version.

The output values include a status code and two revisions which are supported by the RMM: a lower revision and a higher revision .

- The higher revision value is the highest interface revision which is supported by the RMM.
- The lower revision is less than or equal to the higher revision .

The status code and lower revision output values indicate which of the following is true, in order of precedence:

- a) The RMM supports an interface revision which is compatible with the requested revision.
- The status code is RMI\_SUCCESS.
- The lower revision is equal to the requested revision.
- b) The RMM does not support an interface revision which is compatible with the requested revision. The RMM supports an interface revision which is incompatible with and less than the requested revision.
- The status code is RMI\_ERROR\_INPUT.
- The lower revision is the highest interface revision which is both less than the requested revision and supported by the RMM.
- c) The RMM does not support an interface revision which is compatible with the requested revision. The RMM supports an interface revision which is incompatible with and greater than the requested revision.
- The status code is RMI\_ERROR\_INPUT.
- The lower revision is equal to the higher revision .
